James Caldwell High School,"['James Caldwell High School is a great school with lots of different opportunities available. For a small school, there is always a lot going on. The tight knit student culture is great and comforting.', ""Overall it is a very good high school to prepare you for college. Unfortunately, I was bullied a lot and the administration didn't do anything to help me. They were very bias whenever I went to them and always picked  the other person;s side even when I had evidence against that person."", 'I enjoy going to James Caldwell High School, the school is very clean and modern but changed could be made.Some of the teaching staff could be fixed, as many students tend to have complainants about specific teachers but nothing is done. I think that students opinions and changes they suggest should be considered. It would greatly benefit the school and many students future.', 'My experience at James Caldwell High school so far, would be considered lucky. I feel lucky to be apart of this school, because of all the resources provided in order to make learning easier. The school also provides the students and staff with a lot of safety procedures, in order to keep the students and faculty\'s lives safe. I am very aware that there are schools around the nation, that aren\'t as fortunate as James Caldwell, to have resources even as simple as a textbook. Although most students do not take into consideration all the ""luck"" we have in order to learn with our resources, I do think about how lucky I am. That is why when I walk into James Caldwell High School, I feel fortunate to know that I am able to learn with a lot of resources that can boost my skills in learning. I learned over the years, not to take such objects for granted.', ""The overall high school experience was great but it was mainly due to the students around me. There are many great teachers, but there are a handful that aren't nearly as passionate. Another con of this school is the disparity of extracurricular activities. Sports get way more funding and focus than they deserve, leaving the music program and other clubs lacking. Even within the sports scene certain sports get more attention then they deserve. It was wholely up to the students to create a substantial music and club presents. There is a lack of initiative from the administrative front to help non-athletic programs progress and grow."", ""James Caldwell is a pretty good high school as it goes. The administration isn't the best but they are friendly and fair with their jobs. The teachers are mostly all friendly with the odd one or two who are kind of off. The school has really good sports programs probably because they put more money into sports than they should, which kind of leaves nowhere near enough for academics. I'd still say that even with old books that are falling apart, our academics are still very good because of how many classes we're offered as electives that we get to choose. The electives give us the option to choose certain classes that we specifically want to take along side our required classes. Diversity isn't the best just because of the area we live in. They offer us a lot of support for after high school like guidance counselors giving us special meetings to help us find college prospects as well as scholarships, and give us classes on how to do taxes and find housing."", 'I like the choices for regular classes, language classes, electives, clubs and activities, and the guidance department.

On the first day of school, our principal said this was the ""place of the possibilities"". I made new friends, joined new clubs, sports and other activities at James Caldwell. I discovered myself here and this school has helped shape me into the person I am today. I enjoy coming here because it is more than just school.

Both my daughters were active in the music program which also benefits from great faculty and  well-organized parent support. The administration is solid, but what keeps me from giving this school 5 stars is the lack of a real, tangible effort to outwardly address issues of race and gender.', 'Very good school for overall student involvement and growth. I find the resources, teachers, as well as the administration supportive to the students. School culture and diversity is good.', ""As a public school, it was accommodating to the needs of high achieving students, but it lacked encouragement to those students who weren't always in the spotlight.

The minorities are looked down upon. An idea would be having teachers go to workshops that include how to deal with different students and situations. A big part of students going to school feeling like they are less than is because of the administration. The core classes in my school do not include honors courses, they have dual enrollment classes that make it impossible to pass with the amount of workload they give us. They also have AP classes that are helpful if passed. All of the classes are super challenging. The electives are super boring and they don’t have anything that is based on any career field.

They do not let you slack and provide you with a lot of work that will make you prepared for tests and college. One thing that I don't like is how strict the school is. The teachers and administrators don't want to hear you or your explanations and can be close-minded.

Long Beach High School,"[""I had an amazing experience while attending Long Beach High School. They facilitated many sports and classes that gave everyone a chance to study their interests. They ranged between artistic and cultural classes such as IB Dance to express themselves. They had even had on classes such as Auto shop, metal shop and even woodshop. There are not many things that I want to change in our school. I would like our school to focus a little bit more on the sciences and mathematics that they provide. They should have more AP classes presented rather than a full IB class selection in many areas. This could easily be fixed and I'm still glad they provide accelerated courses in ours school."", ""What i liked about long beach unified school district is how they have the resources I need and there's a staff there to help you with whatever it you need."", 'As a freshman, coming from a middle school in a small town, that consisted of 80 students per grade, I could safely say that transitioning to Long Beach High School was daunting, to say the least. However, with friendly students, helpful teachers, and a plethora of courses and clubs to choose from, I settled in quite nicely and quickly.  Being the only Freshman, to get into the school drama, ¨You Can´t Take it with You¨, I made some of my very best friends. All of which were older and helped guide me throughout the rest of my high school journey. Ever since, I´ve participated in 6 other school shows, portrayed leading roles, and became an active member of the Thespian Honor Society.  Through Long Beach High School´s theater program, I´ve grown as a person and have just flat out grown-up, with my best friends by my side. This goes to show that Long Beach High School had the resources and clubs that I needed to discover my passion, and for that, I couldn´t be more grateful.', 'This is a great school with a lot of cultural and racial diversity. The campus is right on the bay. It offers a lot of clubs and sports as well', ""I was fortunate enough to attend a great school district that cares about the students and their future careers that they will one day pursue. The staff from the middle school and high school I attended provide opportunities for student to aid and help them. For example, they have amazing college advisers in my high school's College and Career Center in which they host workshops for students to complete college application, scholarships like this one or financial aid."", 'The faculty at Long Beach are astounding. They have a passion and a drive to see that the students succeed in every aspect of their lives and the years ahead of them.', 'In Long Beach High School the teachers are very nice. If you have any question there is always someone around to answer it for you. The hallways and bathrooms are kept clean by the awesome janitors who will always interact with the students. The only down side (probably like almost every other school) the school food could be better.', 'I moved in Long Beach about 3 years ago from Brooklyn, NY. I took online school: Laurel Springs for my 2 years of 8th and 9th grade. Transferring from online school to Long Beach High School, was at first a big transition. But the overall welcoming community from this high school opened me to multiple opportunities from sports to clubs and activities. I personally joined the tennis team because I enjoyed the sport, but it also allowed my to meet so many new friends. I was also interested in the theater production and I contributed to many plays and musicals as well. Overall, my high school showed me many opportunities in academics and my education. Also, my guidance counselor greatly helped me with my preparedness towards my college and my future.', 'Have teachers be more understanding and flexible. Some teachers refuse to understand that we play sports and take other classes. Few also refuse to understand our conflict', 'Throughout my entire four years at Long Beach Polytechnic High School, I have never had a bulling issue. The school is very diverse and the teachers and staff are trustworthy. I can easily confide in any teacher and any faculty. The sports teams are beyond amazing. I was part of Long Beach Poly Cross Country from 2015-2018 and it was a memorable experience. It was not a team but a family. The coaches, Coach Nate and Coach John, were very encouraging and always pushed the athletes further than the athletes thought they can do. It’s my last two months at Long Beach Poly and I still confide in both of these coaches with everything and anything.', ""My experience in Long Beach High School has had its ups and downs. I would like to talk about the resources provided within the school. During my senior year at this high school, I faced hardships within my home life that began to affect my academics. The school then provided me with a therapist that was separate from the school district, and I was also able to visit the school's psychologist any time I felt it was necessary. The majority of the teachers here are more than understanding and kind. The school culture is very good, no one is extremely kind but no one is looking to harm anyone. What I would like to see changed at this school, however, is the facilities and the food. The bathrooms have essentially been transformed into vaping-rooms, and the bathroom stall doors are typically broken. This high school has a lot of course options and also offers the International Baccalaureate diploma, which will prepare you for college and make your transcript look excellent."", 'Long Beach High School has a diverse range of children attending. The school is similar to a melting pot containing all races, religions and beliefs. Long Beach High School also created a wide curriculum to help each individual students needs and or interests to help them thrive.', 'If you have your own group of friends they will help you to have a great high school experience. There are great teachers there and you can easily make a connection with them. There are also bad teachers who don’t know how to teach. By being involved in clubs and sports you are able to make new friends and you create a family of some sort.', 'Teachers are extremely caring.  Have grown up in Long Beach and the community is great. Everyone is very polite and mannerly', 'The staff within Long Beach High School is probably the best thing about the school. Everyone is willing to help as long as you give them respect. Whether it is a janitor who you share your problems with or your guidance counselor, the staff at Long Beach High School will always support their students. Success is achieved much easier when people are right behind you. Also,  many challenging classes are offered to the students. Counselors encourage taking these harder classes in order to better prepare for college. Extra help and other programs are available to students who struggle in order to almost ensure success. Another positive of Long Beach High School is the wide-range of clubs available. For any hobby or interest, there seems to be a club for it. The students are always kept busy and always have something that they can do. There is definitely room for improvement in the cafeteria. The food is not good and usually vending machines are not either.', 'Long Beach Senior High School has a very wide variety of classes. However, for those of us who would like to challenge ourselves with difficult classes, it is very difficult to balance our schedules. I struggle to fit all of the classes I would like to take into my schedule.', 'I like that the school faculty really cares about the students. The school offers different programs for students to help them in their academics...like AP and IB programs. Long Beach High offers a variety of electives like tv studio production and architecture .', 'I feel that Long Beach High School had a lot of opportunities to offer the students.   There was not a lot of diversity but I do feel like I learned a lot and am prepared for college.', 'Teachers are very attentive to my daughters needs, security in school is excellent and the students are focused in their studies.

For example, my experience in competitive cheerleading here is what most importantly completed my high school journey. From being grand national champions, 3x big north champio, and 3x state champions, the wayne valley competitive cheer team has achieved so much. Considering this, I am so grateful to have been able to experience these winning moments and  I will never forget it.

It could be pain for through the taxes and cut costs in other areas.', 'At Wayne Valley HS, there is always a lot of activity and out of school things to do. What I loved the most is being a part of Television Production and a Varsity Soccer and Volleyball player.

These past 4 years have been amazing and it has been a pleasure to call myself a Wayne Valley Indian.', 'Wayne valley has been a lot of fun, but also a tough four years. Football games are always a blast in the student section, and the other sporting events are also very fun to attend. Valley has a lot of school pride against our rivals, Wayne Hills.

You could have a teacher that pushes you to the edge, giving hours of homework a night. Or you could have a free period and an easy A. The outcome of this school is literally random, just a roll of the dice. If you don't die from the lack of air conditioning in June, or from teachers and students raising pitchforks against you, you'll die from the lack of knowledge this experience brings."", 'Great classes and teachers to prepare students for college.

The classes and many opportunities they offer here help you learn many new things that help prepare you for when you graduate and go to college. Wayne Valley also has various sports and clubs that you can join in which will then lead you to meet new people and experiencing new things.  For example, my experience in competitive cheerleading here is what most importantly completed my high school journey. From being grand national champions, 3x big north champio, and 3x state champions, the wayne valley competitive cheer team has achieved so much. Considering this, I am so grateful to have been able to experience these winning moments and  I will never forget it. Overall, my experience here at Wayne Valley has helped me discover my love for cheer and has helped me work pass my limits and learn and grow as a person.', 'I believe there is not enough attention paid to the mental health of the students.   It is a very difficult time in kids lives and there is tremendous pressure for success and a lot of competition.  Kids need an outlet that can be trusted.

It could be pain for through the taxes and cut costs in other areas.', 'At Wayne Valley HS, there is always a lot of activity and out of school things to do. What I loved the most is being a part of Television Production and a Varsity Soccer and Volleyball player. Everyone here is always involved and Friday Night lights are always a great experience since I run the student section for my senior year. These past 4 years have been amazing and it has been a pleasure to call myself a Wayne Valley Indian.', 'Wayne valley has been a lot of fun, but also a tough four years. Football games are always a blast in the student section, and the other sporting events are also very fun to attend. Valley has a lot of school pride against our rivals, Wayne Hills.

Same with the sciences, but the history and english teachers are pretty great across the board.', 'I transferred to Wayne Valley in my senior year from Florida.

Athletics here is a huge culture at Wayne Valley. They care about the students and the community.', 'Wayne Valley did a great job at providing opportunities to help educate us in a variety of different teaching methods and subjects to prepare for our later educational or vocational ventures. However, I think that more foreign languages should have been offered, including Mandarin which is widely spoken by the global population and can be helpful for those going into international relations or politics, as well as hands on research opportunities with medical practices and businesses to introduce research for those in the scientific fields as an exciting, rather than daunting, practice.', 'I had a positive high school experience at Wayne Valley.

I found myself socializing with many people and making many new friends. The teachers are always willing to support students and are always available when students need them. The school's safety is of not much concern at all, with there being a police station right next to the campus. With its diverse AP courses, Wayne Valley will have you leaving its doors having an idea of what you want to accomplish in life. I am definitely glad that I was able to spend my four years of high school  at such a good school!"", ""Among the raid of various fake bomb threats, constant remarks of racism and injustice, with vaping and overall mean behavior flooding each corner, this school provides an awful experience. The food is always fried garbage, and overpriced. Kids are always stealing food in the cramped and crowded lunch line, pushing over people. The teaching experience is so inconsistent. You could have a teacher that pushes you to the edge, giving hours of homework a night. Or you could have a free period and an easy A. The outcome of this school is literally random, just a roll of the dice. If you don't die from the lack of air conditioning in June, or from teachers and students raising pitchforks against you, you'll die from the lack of knowledge this experience brings."", 'Great classes and teachers to prepare students for college.  Competitive athletics programs for all students.', 'I attended Wayne Valley for all four years of high school. The academics are very good. Much better than private schools.

I had to teach myself Spanish because my teachers were so low that I couldn’t learn anything before their hard tests. Also, my journalism class was hardly journalism. It was just advanced English. The only time we did journalism was with a teacher helper that was there for college credits.  None of the teachers or students cared when I had anxiety attacks in the middle of class either.

Since there are so many students, It’s really hard for college and guidance counselors to give you the time you need.

I poured in tears when i went to this school, at the last day of my senior year, knowing i would be missing this high school so very much. As for the school overall, its science/math incentive is the core, followed by history. Safety is average, but i definitely recommend this high school for anyone interested in science and math.', 'My experience in this high school was overall between poor and average. I have seen many negative encounters with drama in this school. On the other hand, this high school’s academics and teachers are on par in my opinion as I have learned so much and I believe many of the teachers did an awesome job to their best to make the student college ready. One problem is they do lag behind when it comes to implementing STEM, but they have been improving. They do have a FIRST Robotics Competition, Team 5599 The Sentinels, which I had joined in my senior year and since I graduated, I mentor them too. This team made me the person I am today. The team is a work of art that spreads the message of STEM and professionalism, but unfortunately some of the administration does not truly recognize it.

Most of the students in this program are very intelligent and don't hesitate when faced with academical challenges. However, I cannot say the same for the rest of the school and their programs.

The worst part about this school is how disgustingly overcrowded it is."", 'I’ve had an average experience at Benjamin N Cardozo High School. Teachers vary by some being extremely good and knowing how to teach and others that can’t teach at all. The school can improve by getting better teachers and removing their library system where kids have to wait for a pass in the cafeteria and then enter the library because it takes too much time and is useless. The school has a lot of talent and students perform very well in each school show. There are also a lot of books and help in getting ready for the SAT.', ""I feel as if I have a love-hate relationship with my high school. As adolescents, experiencing new things everyday we tend to have a negative stigma towards school. School is something people dread attending, becoming involved in, or discussing with their family. However, it is the friendships I've formed, the vocal or musical theatre opportunities I have come by, the lessons learned and memories made that have made me want to come back every day, eager even! Yes, there are certain things such as safety, or cafeteria food that seek reform but every high school faces issues as well as positives. Then again, we dread school until we realize years after when it's too late, that it was the best years of our life."", 'I like going to Cardozo, some of the things are just hit and miss. Of course high school is what you make of it, but I would like to see a few things change. There should be more parent involvement and more school spirit.

Yes, my high school was overcrowded and the halls were filled with too many people when moving around to get to class but I miss that busyness of school. I loved my teachers and peers and the workload was challenging but easy to manage. There were many clubs that were offered, which was the best part about this school.

My son went to private school up until 8th grade, he didnt hesitate to apply to Cardozo. Academics are equivalent to private schools."", ""My experiences in Cardozo so far have been good so far. I have good friends, my grades are really good and many of the teachers are good at what they do. Plus there is a lot of activities and clubs to do in and after school so it is never boring. Although the security in the school isn't the best they try."", 'My experience with Cardozo was a pretty good one overall. The High School has a lot of  AP and Honors classes that I was able to take part in and these classes were challenging which I enjoyed. The faculty is very caring and helpful for the most part. Cardozo was a great experience from beginning to end.', 'When I attended Cardozo, I thoroughly enjoyed myself there and all the teachers were nice to me.  The safety of the school did start to go down in my later years of attending but with the friends and connections I made will always be one of the reasons why I love the school.', 'Hidden secret are the amazing programs like DaVinci, Journalism, Dance and Law. Fantastic educational opportunities abound and the teaching staff are excellent! Do not listen to the media attention that has been blown out of proportion and enjoy this genuine high school experience.', 'I really miss this high school because of the close relationships i had with friends and professors, in general. I poured in tears when i went to this school, at the last day of my senior year, knowing i would be missing this high school so very much. As for the school overall, its science/math incentive is the core, followed by history. Safety is average, but i definitely recommend this high school for anyone interested in science and math.', 'My experience in this high school was overall between poor and average. I have seen many negative encounters with drama in this school. On the other hand, this high school’s academics and teachers are on par in my opinion as I have learned so much and I believe many of the teachers did an awesome job to their best to make the student college ready. One problem is they do lag behind when it comes to implementing STEM, but they have been improving. They do have a FIRST Robotics Competition, Team 5599 The Sentinels, which I had joined in my senior year and since I graduated, I mentor them too. This team made me the person I am today. The team is a work of art that spreads the message of STEM and professionalism, but unfortunately some of the administration does not truly recognize it. Moving on to safety, from my freshman year to my senior year and continuing, safety has been become a huge issue in this school. Many students and staff do not feel safe in this school.', 'Cardozo was alright. Some of the teachers made the school memorable for me and really shaped me into who I am today. They made me work hard, so that I could graduate in my senior year. I was grateful for those handful of teachers', ""The rules are strict and not affective. Some teachers can't control their classes and it affects both students and teachers."", ""Benjamin N cardozo is a large diverse school where I was presented with many opportunities of taking a large variety of different classes like Da Vinci Math/Science Institute in which students take of challenging advanced and college level courses and foreign language. Besides this the social experience was great due to the diversity and numerous amounts of extracurricular activities of clubs and sports. There's also many parent voulnteers helping out with the college application process and the counselors are always there to help. What i would like changed is more strict safety regulations throughout the hallways and bathrooms."", 'I am a sophomore. Dozo is very nice . It’s diverse, there are lots of programs and sports. The classes and opportunities are good', 'I somewhat enjoyed my high school experience here. It was nothing amazing, just normal. The food, sports, clubs were all okay. There were some very passionate teachers who were great but also some who looked like they hated being there. Overall the school is just okay.', 'It is a great school with great students the teachers really care about their students. Another thing I reallly like about Cordoza is that teachers are really involved with the students', 'I loved every moment of my 4 years at Cardozo, also known as ""dozo"". I was able to develop my passion in dance while excelling in the law program. There were soo many different types of students that you were introduced to sooo many cultures. It was an awesome time.', ""While the DaVinci program is an outstanding program that allows students to engage in either biomedical activities or engineering. Most of the students in this program are very intelligent and don't hesitate when faced with academical challenges. However, I cannot say the same for the rest of the school and their programs. Many of the students seem uninterested and complain about faulty teachers all throughout their journey from one class to another. The worst part about this school is how disgustingly overcrowded it is."", 'I’ve had an average experience at Benjamin N Cardozo High School. Teachers vary by some being extremely good and knowing how to teach and others that can’t teach at all. The school can improve by getting better teachers and removing their library system where kids have to wait for a pass in the cafeteria and then enter the library because it takes too much time and is useless. The school has a lot of talent and students perform very well in each school show. There are also a lot of books and help in getting ready for the SAT.', ""I feel as if I have a love-hate relationship with my high school. As adolescents, experiencing new things everyday we tend to have a negative stigma towards school. School is something people dread attending, becoming involved in, or discussing with their family. However, it is the friendships I've formed, the vocal or musical theatre opportunities I have come by, the lessons learned and memories made that have made me want to come back every day, eager even! Yes, there are certain things such as safety, or cafeteria food that seek reform but every high school faces issues as well as positives. Then again, we dread school until we realize years after when it's too late, that it was the best years of our life."", 'I like going to Cardozo, some of the things are just hit and miss. Of course high school is what you make of it, but I would like to see a few things change. There should be more parent involvement and more school spirit. However, I love the shows that are put on, for example the musicals, the talent and fashion shows, etc.', 'I loved high school. Yes, my high school was overcrowded and the halls were filled with too many people when moving around to get to class but I miss that busyness of school. I loved my teachers and peers and the workload was challenging but easy to manage. There were many clubs that were offered, which was the best part about this school. I feel like everyone knew each other despite the large population and we were all somewhat friends. There were many events too, which I enjoyed.

My son has taken their internship classes which has been a positive experience too.', ""I'm currently a senior and I love my school. Though it lacks diversity and the building is a little old, I have had my best memories in this school.  The music program is excellent, and there are many opportunities for students to participate in clubs, societies and a variety of classes.  I've personally enjoyed the international trips, drama club, orchestra and many of the school's AP classes.  The teachers are generally funny, kind and knowledgeable about their subject of choice. I have enjoyed my time here and will look back on high school fondly because of Plainedge."", ""It's a semi small school which keeps class sizes small and ensures everyone knows each other. Sports are very good but the school seems to prioritize them over academics at points. Offers honors and AP courses but only 1-2 AP classes are offered per course which means you might not even be able to take them if they don't fit perfectly into your schedule.

The amount of material the school provided is very limited and outdated, however, the teachers are very fluent with such materials that passed decade ago.  The teachers provide as much help as they can and the faculty provides as much trouble on you as they can. No school uniform but if you wear something like skirt or tank top, they mind chase you and harass you throughout the day. Less than 30 teacher+faculty means when you need recommendation letter, you are on your luck. Couple guards in the building that never prevents trouble but with attitudes.

Also, during my 4 years of school life, I see no drug, fight, or etc.', 'Dual Language definitely does not rank high when it comes to diversity, seeing as how the school population is 95% Asian students. However, it sets the bar pretty high when it comes to academics and student performance. They provide rigorous courses with hardcore curriculum in order to encourage students to strenuously work hard in their classes. This is quite a small, close-knitted school with a staff count of around 30 people and student population of about 400. Therefore, staff and students are able to connect on a closer level because of the benefits of a more intimate environment. But, Dual Language falls short when it comes to extracurricular activities. Many extracurricular activities revolve around the Asian culture such as Kpop Club, Taekwondo, Lion Dance Club, etc. Dual Language could do a better job trying to stretch the ethnic spectrum and encourage new activities that are derived from other cultures as well.', 'High school for Dual Language and Asian Studies will destroy any abilities you may have as a free thinker in society. The school promotes conformity as a value it instills within its students and inspires no free thinking. Students, upon entering this school, find themselves depressed, completely stressed out, but no administrative services that care enough to do anything until it begins to reflect badly on the school. If you love your child, do not send them to this school. Beyond having a very detrimental environment for the wellbeing of students, the academics fail us tremendously. Teachers do not teach in the classrooms, but instead give reading materials and expect students to learn on their own, essentially rendering them useless in the classroom setting. Students who leave the school often feel unprepared and, despite the heavily and painfully intense environment, most students are accepted to mediocre schools as best, if any at all.', ""I love how the student body and staff is a close-knit community. I get to know my teachers and classmates really well, and it's a supportive environment. I have the opportunity to meet new students from my classes, and it's comforting to see familiar faces in the hallways.The student diversity has been growing, and it's been amazing to learn new things about different cultures."", ""One thing I like about this school is that there are many AP classes I can take.  With these Ap, I don't need to retake the courses in college.  It kind of saving my tuition and time in future.  But there are also the negative sides about having abundant courses, which is a lot pressures are being put onto the students as well.  Many students are stressful.  In addition, another thing that I think my school could improve is try to have more extracurricular activities, so that students can have more places to release their pressures."", ""The school environment is very calm so there rarely are any rules being broken. Dress code rules are very strict and heavily enforced. However, a lot of teachers do not show interest about their students' grades and a few even talk about failing students with 65 averages even though 65 is passing. This isn't a bad school but I wish the faculty showed more interest if my grades are worsening and that teachers could be a little more lenient with students that are struggling but are trying their best. Some teachers even threaten their students with failing them when they need to help them, not threaten them. The faculty only talks to me when they need something from me but never because they are interested in how my day is going or simply just a friendly hello. They make it obvious I'm just a statistic to them. I hope someday this could improve.

There is something for everyone to get involved in and its because the teachers are willing to devote their time and effort.', 'Many teachers go above and beyond. But there are a few that show favoritism towards certain students. Other than that the teachers are very knowledgeable and help us as students achieve our best.', ""The security is very good in our school for people the security guard and police officer don't recognize, but students simply could, theoretically, walk in with a lethal weapon,"", ""There are really only a few extracurricular activities worth mentioning. Our JSA chapter is one of best in the North/Sounthaast and a model for chapters around the country. It's very easy to become absorbed and to interact with many students in our extensive area to discuss regional and national political issues."", 'I really enjoyed my stay at this school for the education and small tight-knit community since the school is very small. The only issue I really had is with the administration. The principal is in his delusional little world, hypocritically preaching god knows what about peacemaking and bullying. There are also very few freedoms in this school as a student', 'The teachers I received being in the STEM Academy were for honors classes and were of the utmost quality. As regards to my non-honor counterparts, they did not receieve the same quality. In fact, I felt as many of the regular teachers gave no effort in their classroom. But I also felt that I had the best education possible through my Academy teachers.', 'Overall decent. The school lacks technology.', 'There are man safe policies at my school, especially with recent stories in the news about school shootings and terrorist attacks. The principal is trying to do everything in his power in order to ensure our safety, which I commend him for. I do like that he is taking the initiative, and is now making the students as well as the faculty wear IDs. Also, we have been having multiple lock down drills to ensure that everyone knows that it can be a very serious thing, and one day it might not be just a drill. Health programs are fine as well. I do not get sick too often, though I know that the nurse is doing her job and that is all that students could ask for.', ""There are many extracurricular activities in our school, for many different interests. There is a book club, or book lovers, or a newspaper club, for people who love to write. There are many more, which enable students to become active in school and in the community, opening doors for individuals that may have certain interests. The school does offer many clubs and organizations, though depending on who they are, people just aren't willing to go to the meetings. Unless you are set on joining a certain club, people usually stop going to club meetings within 2 weeks. That is the only issue I see with the clubs that are in Secaucus High School."", 'The reason I like Secaucus High School, is because of how close-knit, not only the school is, but the community as well. The town is so small you may see anyone you know right around the corner. Secaucus High School has become a safe space for my friends and I, ensuring that we get a great education as well as allow us participate in activities that may be of interest. Even though it may be a small town, there is an unlimited amount of sports and extracurricular activities to do for students in the town of Secaucus. The education aspect, may not be the best, though Secaucus High School is a patriotic, loving educational facility that focuses on all aspects of what makes a great school.', 'There are many teachers that are very knowledgeable in a certain topic, though others may not have the best credentials, or knowledge to teach certain classes. For example, my AP Biology course is not being taught, by someone I believe is capable of doing so, so it is mostly self-study in that class. Though for AP Calculus, there may be a heavy workload, however my teacher works to her fullest potential to ensure that everyone stays on top of the work and understands what she is teaching. It depends on certain subjects, and the way certain teachers teach it, however overall the teachers deeply care about the students and always try their best to ensure they are getting a good education.', 'I loved high school and I am glad I graduated from there. I know that not everyone felt this way and some kids who probably felt left out would say it was clique-ish. I must disagree with that, I love my friends and I was friends with everyone , whenever a new student came we would make them feel welcomed.', 'Its okay if you just want to get through High School.', 'The clubs and organizations offered at my school are very supportive. The teachers and administration is always involved, especially the school government organization I participate in, JSA. The administrator their devotes most, if not, all of his time and money to the events we partake in. The sports clubs my school also offers are some of the very best. The students are always motivated and know they have chances at winning their games.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Peer pressure, bullying, etc. are prevalent, but not very prevalent.

I adjusted quickly, felt welcomed by the positive environment, and found a group of friends who changed my life forever. It's amazing how you can go into something thinking that you'll hate it, and find that it's just the opposite. All teachers, students, and faculty are friendly and open to helping everyone succeed in every subject. CPEHS is filled with overachievers who motivate the entire community to continue to do well and be college ready. After three years at CPEHS, I've learned a lot of life lessons from those around me.

All in all, this school is fantastic, and I personally love it just how it is!', ""Im a junior in Cpehs and i absolutely love being a student in this school. I would not trade it for any other. Everyone has their cup of tea, and this school is mine. I've never been more proud to say this is my high school. All the teacher here are very encouraging and supportive. It's a very small community and so everyone knows everyone. You are very likely to get one on one help from teachers which is very hard in other schools. Cpehs also has a very low tolerance for singleing people out, bullying, fights, and promotion of these activities of any kind. Being here for three years i have not seen one fight. Im happy to say that in 2018 i will be graduating from Central Park East High School."", 'Central Park East High School is a public school that strives to help every student get i to college.

Having attended Baldwin schools for 13 years of my life, I am starting to see the value of the town's incredible diversity. Now attending college out-of-state, it is absolutely fascinating to see how small minded other students can be. Most of my peer's high schools were composed 95% of white students, and their lack of knowledge and respect for other cultures is concerning. Living in a country where diversity is rapidly increasing, schools are preparing students to not only be well-educated members of society, but to be open-minded and accepting of other cultures as well. While I don't intend to take away from Baldwin's stellar teachers, championship-winning sports program, or loving community, I felt it necessary to stress the impact of the school's diverse culture.

As someone who lives in Long Island which has very high taxes, I was expecting there to be more hands on STEM activities for student so we can know what we want to do for college as technology is advancing. I see the public education system is still backwards expecting us to do repetitive and non practical assignments that have no value. There were no trips or significant recreational activities that many other high schools around the area have. The teachers in the Advanced courses in math, science, and history were good but the language teachers were terrible.

Security is very good here.', ""Overall, Centereach is a good school. the teachers are mostly good, many offer weekly extra help.

The music department is fantastic, I have nothing but love for all of the music teachers and programs they're involved in."", 'I like the fact that at centereach high school  most of the teachers are very knowledgeable and very willing to share that knowledge with you.
