I can't speak for other students, but the teachers I've had (some of them) got distracted easily by the kids who would start trouble and if I wasn't the determined person I am, I believe that I would have a very difficult time focusing like other students. That's why most students don't care and give up."", 'For Hempstead High School you really need to focus on graduation and checking up on your grades to make sure they are actually in the system. There are many experiences in that school that I can not make up. Most of them was loosing class grades after taking the class 3 times. I wish for the best if anyone is trying to graduate.', ""I have been going o this school since 2016-2020 and i have met great people here our school has a bad reputation because some of the students don't care about school or isn't able to keep going and some fights happening but recently there hasn't been any fights and I don't think it is fair for the school to get backlash I want the school who has helped me become better be better.

I only hope it would improve and the violence would stop."", 'I enjoy the genuine interest of some the teachers. Many will stay after school or come on the weekends to help you study and further your college readiness. The guidance counselors are always willing to help and they offer many resources.

There teachers at least the ones I've had were great at teaching me i was a bit hard headed about doing the work but i got through it with the help of most of my teachers they new i had potential that and could do my work if i just tried and did my home work i would be able go and do something great. But for me just knowing was fine i didn't have friends there so relying on movies and tv when i got home was more exceptional for me. Bit if i had been more attentive in my studies maybe i wouldn't have to try getting so many scholarships i would be offered them instead but here i am didn't listen to the teachers so here i am."", 'Hempstead High School is a very interesting school I could say. There could be more things to help out the students. More interactive school activities for different types of majors.', 'What I liked about Hempstead High School is that teachers and staff care about you, I also liked that the school is very involved in extracurricular activities. The school offers many clubs and sports. College advisors help you out a lot and last when it comes to extra help or studying for regents exams some teachers go out of their way to help you in every way possible.', 'In my experience attending Hempstead high school, I would try to change the publicity the school receives. In my four years attending, there were several major changes in regards towards college readiness, advanced courses, and opportunity that went unaccounted for. As a student who saw the opportunity in advance courses made it my goal to attended at least one college course every semester. With the help from faculty members, I received college courses from accredited schools that opened my horizon to more opportunity. The media focuses too much on the negativity that occurs but does not acknowledge the positive change and growth that happens at Hempstead High School.', 'What I love about Hempstead High school is that is a big school, clean and all the teachers were kind and would help anyone who ask.', 'What I loved about my school was that from teachers to staff members and guidence councilors they all try there  best for students  to get good grades and pass there classes and regents. They also try there best to make us feel like young adults and to make right decisions in life decisions that will make us harvest our future. What I’d like to see change is the way they schedule our classes and to be more responsible with students overall requirements also what I’d like to see change is that students shouldn’t have to wear uniforms to school because I feel its giving us less liberty and also the fact that they detain us if we don’t wear it. Students shouldn’t have to worry about if they’ll be allowed in school according what they wear unless it is inappropriate the the school dress code. Other than that the school is amazing', 'The overall attitude of the students would be essential in turning around the school. Students are focused on anything but an education which is why the school does poor.', 'First off, respect due to Mr. Roy, Mr. Levi, Ms. Hazel and Mr. Jackson. I attend Hempstead high, and it’s not THAT bad. The news portrays the terrible things that go on in the school, while there is much good to combat the bad. The food isn’t bad but it could be much better, the students are not so nice, facilities are old and worn down..college readiness isn’t enforced. Hopefully I can graduate and get out and just move on. Maybe the school may get better overtime. I’ll try to go back and help out, but other than that, Hempstead is okay, it’s really not the best but I’m proud of my school (somewhat). Shoutout to the senior class of ‘18', 'My experience at Hempstead high school has shaped me into the person I am today. However, being that I go to Hempstead high school, I have many limits on education. Hempstead is known to be a failing school. It is believed that the students who go into or leave the school are also products of failure. However, I am not the product of what the society expects me to be. Attending a school that is known to be an insufficient school for years, I have to work 10 times harder to be in the same bracket as other students who attend a school that is known to be successful. Hempstead can be a great school if all teachers and students applied themselves. Even the board of education can be more involved with the school and actually ask and give the students what we need such as a new field. I run track, and the track on the field is horrible making it hard to practice. My friends and some faculty made me really enjoy my experience at Hempstead high school.', 'This school is better than what the news and other sources make it out to be. The environment is very easy to learn in and fun at the same time.', ""My experience at Hempstead High School has been good. I would like to see a change in the staff, I feel as many do not care about how they teach and they tend to treat all the students the same. I also feel like administration should do a better job with making every child feel safe, because I feel as if I always have to be careful no matter if I'm not doing anything wrong. The school overall has been okay, just like any other school. I sometimes which that all sports where also treated the same such as football and the volleyball team. Ive experienced it first hand where I felt like giving up. Listening to girls in class talk about there cool uniforms and headbands, when the  sport I was doing did not have any uniforms and any equipment that we needed to perform good in our sport.

You won’t find any other school where the teachers are as extremely dedicated to uplifting their students. Granted, there are administrators who aren’t up to par and even students who give you bad days, but being a bulldog (our mascot) is being family. We look out for one another and without a doubt want to see our classmates succeed. Love surrounds our atmosphere and friendships even though our circumstance may be lacking. We’re inner city kids with big futures ahead of us, and our school is so impactful we will proudly claim our alumni status. Thank you.', 'After moving 3 times my high school years, I finally landed at Shabazz in which I was forced to follow through with and graduate. I’ve been in other schools where you know the education is no joke, the tests are all worth studying for, and the athletics are something you need to compete in because if you get in, prepare to be trained like a professional. However, Shabazz is the complete polar opposite. Teachers who don’t want to teach and students who run the classroom. A fight in each hallway, and security guards smoking up right outside our “safe zone” of a school. Overall, this whole place is a joke and I genuinely feel horrible for the teachers who’ve been there long enough to know there will never be improvement because they themselves have tried, and failed.', 'Malcolm x shabazz has one of the best history I have heard.

As of now the new principle is doing a very good job. The school is more organized , the staff is more professional and the academics are improving.', ""When I got to MXS I was scared out of my mind. I had recently transferred in from a small Liberal Arts HS in Brooklyn and wasn't prepared for the campus-like feel of MXS. It's a very big school, mostly for the athletically talented but there's a space for everyone. School spirit it intense. I ended up joining the cheer squad, geochemistry team, and two honors societies. There are so many resources, there isn't any reason why a person shouldn't make it out Shabazz.

Everybody is super accepting there so most of the students quirks or hobbies are all appreciated and there is always a person who will understand. The teachers are great except for some of the math teachers and some language teachers however all it will force you to do is work even harder to meet your standards grade wise. Other than that though the rest of the teachers are absolutely fantastic and genuinely care about there students and where they end up in life and college.', 'I enjoy the ability to explore areas in which I would like to pursue a career in the future.  With the Biomedical and Engineering classes, it allows students to be even more prepared and advanced compared to other students when going into college.  Even though it is a small school, I think that there should be enough classes so that each student can take all the classes they desire and not be penalized because the class is full.', ""This is a magnet school that accepts by lottery and sibling connection only. This school has great courcecs that the other public schools don't have. It is the newest high school in out district which means that we have btter technology thatn the other scchools. We have a lot of digital reosurces that help with homeowrk. We can take classes that we think are suitable for our college courses."", ""I liked the fact that we had technology at out disposal. However, a lot of the teachers there were only able to teach things one way, so if you didn't quite understand what you were learning there was nothing they could do about it. There were also a lot of teachers who just didn't teach anything at all."", 'AITE is a great school. It has impacted me to become a better student and peer to many. There I have made many friends. With the help of staff and my guidance counselor, I have finally decided what I want to achieve in life. I have finally received the closure I was looking for, for many years. This year as a sophomore I am taking classes based on my field of interest which is either Business or Finance & Banking.', 'Great school! I wish they would let underclassmen take more APs and advanced courses. Amazing Biomedical PLTW program!', 'Overall a great school. The teacher to student ratio is perfect, there’s a lot of diversity and everyone treats others the way they would like to be treated. You will really excel in AITE, especially with the help from others around you.', ""I mean it's pretty good. The people are kind of weird but they're some lit people there. The school isn't the worst however it definitely isn't the best. Might want to switch a few teachers but other than that it isn't that bad."", 'AITE is a good school. Many teachers are willing to help students succeed and there are many resources available for students to use.', 'I like this school because it is college preparatory. It set me up to opportunities like this and gives laptops to students to increase the learning experience.', 'I liked how everyone was very open with their feelings and we were free to express who we are. The teachers help you work', ""I love my high school. They're helping me prepare for college. I'm looking for so many scholarships and my guidance counselor is helping me. If they see you try hard they will help you."", 'The smaller school environment is great and there are some really good teachers here. I do not regret at all coming to AITE because it made me who I am today. One complaint is that the administration is fairly incompetent and does not focus enough on the students. Also there are some teachers that do not teach at all and make life very hard for students so you have to be careful what classes you take.', 'The Academy of Information Technology and Engineering is a school with a variety of courses that no other school offers. Rated one of the top high schools in Connecticut, AITE is yet to improve in very critical deparment areas. For example, the Math Department, there are more teachers that dont teach the material seriously.', 'The Academy of Information Technology and Engineering is a great school overall. We have classes that not many high schools have such as  Medical Interventions, Sports and Entertainment Management, Multimedia,  Arabic, and a lot more. We are advanced when it comes to variety in course selection. There will always be a class pertaining to any major, and if not, students are allowed to take a class online with Virtual High School. The teachers are excellent in providing students with college readiness. AITE is fantastic, however there are some minor setbacks, such as no sports teams and limited after school activities. But overall the experience at AITE is advanced because of the expansive classes, and admirable because of faculty, staff, and students.', 'My favourite part of AITE as a student was being able to take as many AP college classes as I wanted because I liked the ability to challenge myself.  I really appreciated the debate team as well, which anyone should join.', 'the school gives you the illusion of freedom and actually encourages you to learn. it forced you to make decions that can decide your future within the school', ""AITE is a great school. It is unique compared to other local high schools because it provides students with a laptop and offers PLTW Biomedical Sciences and Engineering classes. Overall, the teachers are okay. They have a fantastic science department, but the math department needs some better teachers. I would like to see AITE have their own sports team because it's troublesome for some students to go to their district school to play sports."", 'I love the diversity and the amount of technology available at the school.

They always know what they are doing and always help me by providing their useful knowledge. The administration is fantastic. The Principle and Assistant Principle are both very kind and extremely involved with everything that goes on. The school food is great because it's made by the culinary class!
