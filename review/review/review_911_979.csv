Juan Morel Campos Secondary School,"['I like Juan Morel Campos because the teachers treat you very nice, they help you with what you need, you always feel like that is your second home', 'Trash teachers were not helpful at all always favoritism in this school. Teachers pick and choose who to help SCHOOL IS TRASH', 'Juan Morel Campos is a school from grades 6-12. The care for students and the students can always rely on the teachers for support. The school is very diverse, however, clubs are not present due to lack of willing students. The school is average with academics but shines in the arts. Juan Morel Campos is known for art exhibitions and musical performances by a collaboration of the band and theatre departments. The school is very accepting of race, religion, and sexual orientation.', 'My experience in Juan Morel Campos has been great. I have been here since 6 grade and bow im in 11th. The staff are great as well as most of the teachers.', ""I am currently going into my senior year. I've been with the school since middle school. through the past few years, I've been challenged in all aspect at this institution it made a great impact on me as a person and academically"", 'Entering Juan Morel Campos my 6th grade year was extremely scary to me. New surroundings, new people, new teachers, etc. there would be fights almost everyday and teachers who were just unreasonable. It was the definition of horror. But as the years went by you could sense a shift in attitudes not only within the staff but within the students as well. It got a bit more strict and there were more students determined to get better scores and graduate. As a Graduate from Juan Morel Campos I am proud to say that this school has actually come a far way from what it used to be. The new principle is great and can actually handle the students unlike former principles. She leads by example and was kind enough to share her high school experience with most of us. She has a very big heart and though she may be strict she wishes nothing but the best for her students and makes sure they are always on track to succeed.', 'It has been many years since my time at J.M.C.S.S. and after graduation I parted ways with not only the school, but many of the individuals affiliated with the school. The teachers were unprofessional and really struggled to maintain control in the classroom. I recall the college counselor really not paying any mind to myself or some of my peers and I feel it is due to her lack of faith in us. As a young adult I feel that negative environment only fosters negative behavior. It took me attending a college out of state to find a mentor that believed in me and pushed me to challenge and better myself.', 'My experiences at Juan Morel Secondary High School are okay. With the students, majority are really kind and outgoing. I feel like all the students should be culturally diversed, to get to know different nationalities.For the teachers, most are definitely here to see the students growth academically and mentally. Although, I feel that most don\'t take their job seriously and act more as a friend to students than an advisor or teacher. Or even mistreat the students because they ""act up"" not knowing there must be more to the story on why students are behaving that way. The staff and administrators treat EVERYONE like family. Despite being black , Asian or Muslim or any race that isn\'t Hispanic. Being in this school has a homey delicate feeling.', 'They genuinely care for the students and constantly try to motivate them to do better']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,,,

At Pathways the teachers are they're for you. They want you to strive for success and the teachers will do anything to see it happen.

One thing I love about pathways is the system will push you to show you can do better than you think, but it's not too much force.

I have been here since 5th grade and I even wanted to give the high school a shot. This school is horrible nothing but a let down. Some teachers are cool but most only care about your business and they bash the neighborhood the students grew up in. The new grading system is horrible and the school is very unorganized. The Principal has had the school open for I don't know how long and still hasn't been able to find a building where a high school can be at. It's unfair , unorganized and boring . No opportunities nothing at all If I could transfer I would but I'm stuck here - A 10th grade student at Inwood"", 'At Inwood Academy for Leadership I liked that the classes were small and teachers really knew their students and cared for them.

Another thing is shops, if a shop teacher decides to leave midway through the year it will be to your detriment, it often takes administration at least half a year to find a replacement, I've even seen it go for two years."", 'My experience for four years was very good.  I took HVAC for these for years and learned a trade.  It was a very good learning experience for my future.

The students here are also crazy and immature. when you walk the halls you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the students and a zoo, because that's how some of them act."", ""Being involved in this school has allowed me to learn a few things that might help me get through the simpler things in life, such as: learning to fix and work with electrical circuits and learning to work with eletro-mechanical machinery and tools in my shop class. Many of my classmates as well as I, haven't been able to learn much in the field of study (Electro-Mechanical Technology) because the teachers was disorganized, could never find the proper equipment for every project,  and lacked the ability to properly give instructions on those projects.  Most of the teachers have had illegible hand writing , so one would have to play the game of guess the word. During my four years at this high school, there was never a class to help prepare us for college, nor give us the proper basic procedures to go about looking for scholarships, colleges in ones interested field of study, and ways to save money to pay for college."", 'Platt Tech is a great school for someone who likes hands on learning.

I had overall an okay experience here but you're better off going to a different school if you really want to academically learn and be respected by the staff."", ""This school is a huge unorganized mess! Platt Tech is run by people who don't know what they're doing. It's sad to say this school has gone down hill at my last year at Platt Tech. The new assistant principles are pure jokes! Students are sent to ISS for a whole day for the smallest reasons which makes them miss out on a valuable day of education. The administration does not care about the students. A particular assistant principal, Ted Oczkowski, is an unpleasant man who does not care for students opinions or values. He is very rude and disrespectful to students and treats them like prisoners. I always see him yelling and treating others like garbage! Half the academics teachers want to leave Platt Tech and hate their jobs which makes it also very hard for students to learn. The only reason I stayed at Platt Tech was because of shop. Shop is the only saving grace Platt Tech has. This school is old, dirty, and not worth it."", 'Platt Tech has given me the opportunity to figure out what I am good at and what I want to do after I graduate from college.

So I'd say freshman year: infant sophomore year: cliqued up junior year: growing up senior year: FINDING YOURSELF"", 'Most teachers at the school genuinely care about the students personally and academically, the others kind just go with the flow... For example: if the class is being disruptive, the teacher would do little to at least get the class\'s attention. The typical stand and stare followed by the saying, ""I\'ll wait"". Teachers who\'ve worked there for more than 5 years, I\'d say care about the students. The principal is a typical ""show and tell"" type of person, she wants outsiders to portray the school as improving, but in reality it\'s still the way it was with the other principle.

Get good grades, encourage others to do better, help the school. If it wasn't for the National Honor Society and the Financial Women's Association, I might have fell down the cracks.

Some of the after school programs kept us in check, and most importantly good friends. My friends and i are catching the case of senioritis, and we have a group chat where we wake each other up, make sure that we hand things in on time, college application completion. I once called my best friend school (Utica college) just to ask about one of their therapy programs. Also my other best friend who wants to get into Syracuse badly, was not hearing back.

Again if there were a basketball game, they would charge students $1-$2 and the gym would be pack and loud. Everyone cheering for that same team. i wish only the superintendent can come to watch this. And the players try to make everyone happy, shooting 3 pointers and yelling. Its like everyone left their negativity at the door and all the positive fill in the air made the game very excitng. But when it is volleyball no one shows up but you're closest friends and that's if they are not too busy."", ""Like any school, you have the teachers that are nice and does not grade well, meaning passing most kids. And my favorite, the strict teachers, nothing gets pass them. It's a lot of work to keep up, but the outcome is beautiful, to have a 100% passing rate does not only help the school, but helps the student. You get excited with confidence and feel as if you can do anything, it becomes motivational. Murry Bergtraum lacks of communication skills not from the teachers, but the students. And to be able to communicate, there has to be 2 or more parties.

I feel as if the school should make more clubs that would actually attract students because obviously not everyone is athletic, into knitting, or chess."", ""what bothers me the most about Mott Hall High School is the students. everyone is really loud, fights all the time (mostly the sophomores), there's been times people have been caught doing sexual activities in the staircase which is disgusting, some girls don't clean up after themselves in the bathroom, everyone is immature, half the students swear they're cool just because they argue or curse out a teacher. one time a student slapped a substitute teacher. about 82% of the students in my school would skip one or more classes per day in the gym."", ""Not all my current or past teachers are bad. but I feel as if most of them don't exactly know how to control the classroom since students are always talking during the lesson, they're messy, some students would curse out the teacher, most don't coorperate, students fall asleep and teachers don't really do anything about it but when they do its just to call the dean. most teachers don't know how to break down the lesson until they get what they're learning (specifically math). but there are a few teachers I've taken that actually do want to help the students and know how to keep their class the way a class should be. also there's some teachers who don't exactly give us as much notes as needed, in my opinion I'd rather learn by writing down what we're learning then reading from a textbook (we don't keep them by the way) or only writing down like 4-5 sentences of what the specific topic is about."", 'Mott hall high school it may have is flaws but is students that make it a bad environment. if one has good standard one would be successful here.', ""This school, Mott Hall High School located at 6 Edgecombe High School in Harlem; isn't very prepared of the students actions.

With that, going into our sophomore year, when new teachers would come they were shocked that we did not understand certain teachings because we were never taught them. Moving into our Junior year the staff started to become more stable because there were 2 other groups of students now, freshmen and sophomores, so they understood how to teach, discipline, and understand the students.

There are many honors classes that this school has to offer. The school is immensely diverse and has provides the students with many extracurricular activities. The principal here is very friendly and will definitely resolve any problems that one might have.

But i dislike how I’m barely getting an education and they think i learn by assigning a great amount of homework. Also how i don’t really learn anything there and there’s barely clubs and activities. I  also hate athlete privilege, how an athlete can get bad grades and still have loads of opportunities and still be in sports and have their life set out before them.

Starting off with their benefits, we do get out of school at a nice time , which is 2 p.m. In CAAS, there are teachers who are always willing to help all the time, especially the seniors. There's a great counselor who is willing to assist you in the direction for college. Extra help is something everyone needs. Also, another thing is this school is small, so therefore everyone knows each other.  Some negatives about the school is they don't offer much college courses to get college credits. That would be helpful if there was more than one college class or more than one AP course. Overall, this school tries it's best to make CAAS feel like a family. "", ""Teachers are okay.

I would say the best part of the school is culinary because they make great food and its a fun and interesting program. Although to school is okay theres some negative things about it and thats due to the type of students in the school.', 'I love Cultural Academy for the Arts & Sciences. Every day I came to this school there was something different I would go through. I would have days filled with enjoyable surprises and days with hardships.

I would recommend any and everybody to go to this school.', ""My experience at Cutural Academy for the Arts and Sciences was incredible and a very interesting experience thus far. In my opinion, Caas has really allowed me to see different opportunities that i would have never thought that i would think to see. Everything at this particular school seems to be on point including the teachers and all the faculty that is present there, the specific classes and the extracurricular activities.  i would recommend upcoming freshmen in high school to try and consider this school because its a huge upbringing to other kids's future"", 'It like everything I want in a school not a lot of kid and the teacher actually do care the guidance counselor have assembly every month to helpbthe kid that are failing get back on track.every teacher care for the student we even have youth court to help the kid that are doing bad It a good school.', ""When I first went to CAAS I took all the classes I needed and I was doing good. As I started taking new classes I felt like some teaches didn't know how to explain themselves properly and didn't know how to make sure at least a majority of the students understood what they were being taught. CAAS is very big on sports, mostly basketball and volleyball; we have a lot of school spirit. There's a good amount of college classes just as long as you take all your necessary classes first. We do not have a lot of clubs mostly try out posters on the walls of our school, but more clubs are being added this year. School saftey isn't a problem, there's security on our floor and at the entrance. We get breakfast at our school but our lunch period is last so we get to eat in class. Overall, CAAS is an average school and you can get enough opportunities if you put yourself out there and stay on top of your work."", ""I feel that CAAS could be an amazing if they some slight changes. In my opinion it would be better if we didn't have to wear uniform."", 'Being in this school for 3 years now,and my experience has been great.The teacher had teach m a lot.', "" Attending Cultural Academy for the Arts and Sciences in other words CAAS, has its benefits and negatives. Starting off with their benefits, we do get out of school at a nice time , which is 2 p.m. In CAAS, there are teachers who are always willing to help all the time, especially the seniors. There's a great counselor who is willing to assist you in the direction for college. Extra help is something everyone needs. Also, another thing is this school is small, so therefore everyone knows each other.  Some negatives about the school is they don't offer much college courses to get college credits. That would be helpful if there was more than one college class or more than one AP course. Overall, this school tries it's best to make CAAS feel like a family. "", ""Teachers are okay. They teach things we don't need to know."", ""Students are cool. They don't act they have problems."", ""I don't think they have opportunities."", 'Some of the teachers are very boring.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""Most of the teachers are nice and easy to talk to, and you really do grow with the students and become a great family, especially when you're a senior."", ""Favorite experience is joining yearbook because even while making the yearbook, we would still talk about our life and ask or give advice to others when they needed help.
