There was zero diversity, they didn't encourage conversation, and shut down any attempt to change the status quo. The administration acts like it is trying to help, but shuts down any internal investigations and pushes their problems aside. Overall, my experience with the teachers there was great, minus a few bad apples, but that is to be expected.

I have had a multitude of engaged, helpful, and highly educated teachers. My school offers so many programs and materials. They are very interested in students concerns.

Fairfield Ludlowe has provided me with great academics and athletics where I would not even think about attending a private high school. As a whole, the faculty and students are supported by the town of Fairfield at all of our home sports games. In return, as athletes and students, Fairfield Ludlowe always finds a way to give back to the needy and community.

Fairfield Ludlowe is a perfect high school acadeically and athletically preparing students to be successful in life while having fun doing what we love.', 'I did not like Fairfield Ludlowe High School very much. While the school offers an abundance of options for classes it is very difficult to fit any electives into your schedule. There are so many required courses that the extra electives are not an option.', 'Fairfield Ludlowe is a overall a high school. It is filled with teachers who strive to help you reach your goals and the students are nice. One drawback is that there is NO diversity (all affluent white kids), but it has a lot of clubs.', ""Ludlowe is pretty great. Teachers are good, classes are good as well. I've had some scheduling problems before but that's about it. Great activities and a great atmosphere."", 'FLHS has amazing academics. The school focuses on each student individually, and students can really excel if they make an effort to do so. The clubs an activities are also exceptional. A few years ago, the school began having an activity period during the day to get more students involved in clubs, and it really works. It is one of the smartest decisions that the school has made. The school also prepares students very well for college with the block schedule and rigorous work. The administration is very good at enforcing the rules, although the teachers are not always the best. Many teachers are wonderful and really care about their students. The other disadvantage is the lack of diversity; some students do come over from Bridgeport on a special program, but there is not must integration between those students and the ""WASP"" type Fairfield-Southport-Greenfield Hill residents. Other than that, Fairfield Ludlowe is a great school, and I cherish my time spent here. ', ""I moved to Fairfield in my junior year and made friends relatively fast that I think will always be there for me in times of need as I will for them. My favorite experience in this school was a trip to Disney and Universail Studios with the orchestra I've played in for 8 years. This is because my friends and i roomed together and bonded at a new level. We stayed up at night telling stories, talking about hot girls we'd be asking to prom, and even listening to use while playing video games. This was an experience that was great for me because I never really went so far away from home with just my friends. If I could've been in this school for all four years of high school I'd be even happier, but I'm satisfied that I spent my last two years in this school.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['There are opportunities to learn anything you want to at this school and guidance counselor try to make sure you get everything on your schedule that you desire.', ""There is a majority of white people at this school and I would say some of them are even white supremacists, however overall everybody cares about each other and doesn't desire to harm anyone."", ""Teachers are very enthusiastic and challenge each student to go above and beyond in everything they do.

Watchung Hills Regional High School,"['I enjoy my experience at Watchung Hills Regional High School. The school has given me many opportunities that other schools do not offer. I gave the rating four stars because I do believe there is room to grow and improve. I think the school needs to focus on diversity and not putting so much pressure on going to college. Most students feel obligated to go to college but some drop out and feel that college is not meant for them. I wish my school offered trade classes.

They offer PLTW (Project Lead The Way) engineering classes and have numerous after school clubs dedicated to the arts, hard sciences, and engineering. The curriculum is what students make of it. It can be very challenging or barely engaging depending on which classes a student chooses.', 'This school is very competitive, but challenges students to reach their full potential. With every club imaginable, different sports and elective courses , one is able to achieve anything they strive for. However, sometimes having a large schools isn’t as beneficial for students. Most sports are incredibly competitive and therefore hard to get into, limiting students top potential. On the other hand, there are tons of clubs that each student is welcome to join which makes up for the sports. Although the schools offers tons of electives from AP to honors and life-learning skill electives (Ex. Culinary arts) I feel as though it lacks electives focused on the medical field. There are tons of electives that are related to law but other than AP biology and AP chemistry there aren’t much on medical field specifically.', ""My experience at WHRHS has been a good one. I've made a lot of friends from all  4 towns that attend the high school, and it is a generally very healthy environment.

Housing around 2000 students, the school comes with many of the ups and downs this brings. On the ups side, the opportunities present are extremely varied, with a slew of elective classes to choose from along with extremely diverse clubs and activities. However, on the downside of things, the sheer size of Watchung Hills makes social life more of a challenge. This inevitably causes cliques to form, a system that also has its own benefits and downsides. In regards to sports and clubs, sports in particular are often fairly tight knit and make for a good way to make new friends. Clubs, however, meet less frequently and for a shorter period of time than sports in most cases, and are less effective at achieving this. Despite that, the sheer volume of clubs is quiet impressive.', 'The education within Watchung Hills Regional High School is why I am extremely grateful to attend this school.

Because of the many music and arts courses I have taken, I know that I will continue the arts in my college pursuits.', 'The academics at this school are unnecessarily hard. I know students who have graduated who come back and tell me that our high school over-prepares us. For example, one of my friends has 126 in one of his classes in college but his GPA in high school was below a 3.0. This might look like an advantage, but it honestly shouldn\'t be considered as one. Students are overworked and are always stressed out. There are times when we have to pull all-nighters due to the unnecessary workload that is given. Students who have low GPAs aren\'t actually dumb or don\'t work hard. It\'s just that the school is hard. With the level of difficulty, the school has a ""no extra-credit"" policy, which is what makes it even worse.

I've had a number of teachers who've really inspired me, been kind to me, and definitely influenced my direction in life. (The history department in particular.) Yes, there is plenty of drama and fights over trivial things, but you'll find that at any school. As a senior, my best advice is to take advantage of all the school offers. Be it clubs, sports, extra help...take advantage of it, and immerse yourself in the culture. You'll get teachers you hate or courses you hate, or have to deal with seemingly incompetent administrators, but in the end, the good memories outweigh the bad.

The school has an ambundous of resources such as technology, art supplies, instruments, biology tools, etc. Overall, there are no major accounts of issues regarding bullying or physical fights. However, one criticism. There is no diversity. It is a very caucasian dominant school, and students here have a very closed-off mindset. I feel as though most students are not very educated about people not like themselves, and therefore don't know how to act around certain minorities.  I have witnessed racial slurs, mostly behind people's backs, and felt very uncomfortable. The worst part of all, administration is not aware nor informed of occurrences like these, therefore there is no action against stopping this.

Sleepy Hollow High School,"['This school is one of the greatest in my opinion. There is an immense amount of diversity between students and growth and enriching courses. Our school also has one of the best school spirit. However, in SHHS there is an utter lack of spreading the message of AP and honors classes to minorities.', ""Sleepy Hollow has a lot of diversity in its student body. All the teachers are passionate about what they're learning."", ""I have really enjoyed my experience thus far at SHHS. The teachers seem to genuinely care about the students' well being and want to see them succeed. The food is subpar but… what do you expect. It's school lunch. Sleepy Hollow is a very diverse neighborhood and this is clearly represented in the school. You will find people of different ethnicities, origins, political stances and household incomes. As with all schools, there are groups and some people believe high school is the most important part of life, but most people are chill, laid back, cool people. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."", 'Perfect school with great students and teachers. The teachers are dedicated to their work and are very wise. They always lend a helping hand and never give up on us. They are the perfect example of teachers that all schools need to succeed.', 'Personally loved my experience going to this school. So much school spirit and the teachers want you to do well and succeed. Guidance counselors are super great and helpful especially when applying to school, they always try to make time to help you.', 'Sleepy Hollow High School is a diverse school with great teachers, administration, and many students who want to learn. The school offers many community service opportunities and work programs. The school also accomodates for students with disabilities. The school not only has a diverse culture but also has a wide range of students from different financial statuses.', ""My experience at Sleepy Hollow has been everything I could've hoped for and I am so grateful to have attended such an incredible school. Our student body is very diverse, which has allowed me to learn from all different perspectives and establish connections to people from various cultural backgrounds. This has truly enriched my education. The academics are excellent, the teachers are kind and friendly, and the overall environment is very welcoming and enjoyable."", ""Unhealthy environment for LGBTQ+ students. Very cliquey atmosphere. Poorer off the Westchester school districts. Block schedule is annoying and doesn't seem to help productivity at all. Lots of nasty rumors about bullying and straight up violence that occurs, even if they are given a fraction of truth."", ""In my opinion, Sleepy Hollow High School is an amazing High School to attend. The teachers and staff are always there to help and support students. The atmosphere here at Sleepy is quite interesting to some students and staff but it's just how it runs here. The amount of programs and equipment that the school buys for the students is astonishing. It just shows how much the staff cares about the student's success. Students can get along with others in clubs, sports, and after-school activities. There's not much to change around the school other than phone rules, hats, school lunch, and or student parking."", 'I liked the diversity and the academics and the amount of courses it offers. I would like to see more languages added to the foreign language department and more clubs that promote world equality and represent people as a whole.', 'Sleepy Hollow High School is a school that is ethically diverse and takes school spirit very seriously. The Headless Horseman is the mascot for the school which makes Halloween extra special because the school encourages the students to dress up and the town does the same. The teachers overall are good but some can be more personal than others. Some teachers rely heavily on powerpoint while others like the lecture style approach. The one thing I would change is to make sure that no student goes to prom alone unless they want to.', 'I received a great education from this school. Diversity is celebrated here and kindness is promoted. Safety is an upmost priority. I do wish that there was a home-ec class provided or mandatory. I do not feel as though I was prepared for college as much as I could have been.', 'teachers are always so helpful and have many office hours if you need help. the students are also very kind to you, especially if you are a new student.', ""High school wasn't really a big part of my life.  I really enjoyed playing baseball because it allowed me to develop strong bonds with many of my current friends.  While some classes drove me nuts, there were a select few like AP Physics, AP Calculus BC, and AP Computer Science that I really enjoyed.  What made these classes so great were the teachers.  They really want to see you succeed and that helped me strive in those classes.  I would strongly recommend reaching out for extra help if you need it as most teachers are willing to work around your schedule.  I do wish the counselors could have been more involved in the college selection process.  While I don't have strong pride in my high school like other students, I am happy I was able to have the teachers I had."", 'I have loved my experience at Sleepy Hollow High School.  I will be sad to leave in June but I know that they have prepared me for the future.  I look forward to continue challenging myself in college.', ""I have been going to Sleepy Hollow High School as a freshman since 2014 and I have loved every bit of it! The teachers have always and continue to be so supportive of their students. Everyone really comes together and it such a tight knit school and I'm glad I have the privilege of graduating from Sleepy Hollow next June."", ""The Sleepy Hollow High School Experience is like no other. One of the things that makes us very unique is the diversity in the school! Everyone is from various parts of the world, yet we all get along and have a good time. Another thing thats great about Sleepy Hollow High School as I've heard from current alums in college is how the teachers prepare you for college. Our school culture is one thing that makes us different from the rest. Being in Sleepy Hollow during October is sure a treat. We attract a lot of tourists and our spirit week is in October. That includes getting ready for the big homecoming football game on saturday, getting together as a grade and decorating the hallways and dressed up according to what theme it is that day. We are nationally recognized because of our mascot The Headless Horseman. Only thing I would change is the food, the food is average."", ""Based on my experience in Sleepy Hollow High School, it's been a wonderful experience shared by friends and teachers. As a Senior Applying to colleges, professional councilors make sure your college ready before fall of senior year. In addition, the one thing when entering and leaving Sleepy Hollow High School is the school spirit. Both Boys and Girls Sports are really competitive and energetic especially, Football, Basketball, Soccer and Wrestling. Academically, its really good to send your child here to get hands on advance learning (Continually getting better)."", 'I loved Sleepy Hollow High school, because it focused very well on diversity, and the students.

The school and academics are good in itself. The teachers are very passionate about what they teach compared to a lot of other schools I've heard of. It's honestly what you make of it. It's a hard school to be quite frank. The people here, aren't exactly the best and I've been involved in too much drama from 6th to 9th grade. Homework is not too hard or long if you manage your time well. This is a school where you can very easily get involved with the community, however, not many kids do. It's quite hard to be independent here, but you honestly can be if you try. But yeah, be aware of these things. You can take Columbia courses though, only if you're eligible and you have REALLY good grades. The dean is strict on the uniform policy, which is annoying. The girl's basketball team was cut off which really sucks, and the only sports that are really focused on are the boy's basketball, and the rugby team. Review by: Alyssa R.P"", ""Overall I have greatly enjoyed my time at BSU and feel that it has prepared me for college in ways that I didn't expect."", ""I went to this school for seven years (middle school and high school) and I can say for sure that they prepared me for college. Their curriculum is STEM heavy, with engineering (with computer science), science, math, and technology all four years. The only thing I have to say is that their music and art curriculum is a little lacking. But there are still art opportunities! There is a musical production every year that takes a whole semester to prepare for. After school there are a number of clubs and electives for every interest (I enjoyed Video Game Club!). We even have a garden, complete with live chickens! College preparedness begins  near the end of your Junior year; I was so ready that I had my college application finished before November, thanks to the college counselors. The teachers are great here, open for help (many of them have office hours). The workload might be tough at first, but it's nothing that students can handle. I will miss the school when I leave for college."", 'As far as New York City schools go, Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science and Engineering is a good school. You are given many opportunities as a student ,like the option to take classes at Columbia University, and there are no shortage in the amount of extra-curriculars you can take. This school also has a large emphasis on rugby and on STEM. The only problems with this school are that it is still young and can be very unorganized at times and also is very competitive with a heavy work load. However Overall it is a really good school and there is always something to do.', 'I really like the diversity at Columbia Secondary School. I’ve gained friends from all around the world from just being in school. Our academics are really good too because we have courses that challenge us beyond the average grade level that we are in.', ""My experience at CSS is very different. There are many highs and lows about the school, just like any other school. But overall, academically, the teachers do the best that they can do to educate us, and  the students recognize that, even if we don't push ourselves to do our best. However, many of the students find CSS challenging due to the workload. But we're all up for the challenge, otherwise we would not be at CSS. CSS is a great school, and should be recognized more for being a great school instead of some of the things that have happened in the past at CSS."", 'I attended CSS for 7 years,and it was quite a unique experience for me.  I felt that the school prepared me well as I go to college in the fall, with both the teachers and the ability to take classes at Columbia University to get a vibe of how college classes are. The school does have some variety of clubs and sports offered for students, but not as extensive compared to other schools,mostly since we share the building with 2 other schools so times for practices and games are limited.', ""CSS prepared me for college and encouraged me to apply to multiple colleges so I'd have a range of options."", ""I attended CSS  from 6th all the way to 12th grade, and was quite happy with my experience.  For its incredible diversity, strong sense of community, and challenging academics, I'd highly recommend CSS. Being able to take CU classes in my later years was a great opportunity, and the small grade sizes always meant that teachers built personal relationships with their students. All that being said, CSS is definitely not a typical selective NYC magnet school, and if that is the experience you're looking for I'd recommend against CSS. The school lacks proper funding, as evident by the cramped hallways and lack of a library, and the sense of competition found at schools like Bronx Science or Stuyvesant is completely absent.  That isn't to say CSS isn't difficult   if you want it to be - its just that the core curriculum (and administration) never push students too far our of their comfort zone. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the school."", ""It was very stressful at times, but the school does prepare the students for college. The school doesn't get much funding, and the administration can be frustrating at times, but it prepares the students for their next steps. Although small, the school has a big sense of community. Columbia Secondary is diverse, and holds events appreciating every bodies culture."", 'I do not hold any grudges towards Columbia Secondary School and am very grateful for the time I had there. The access to various college course options were tremendously helpful and the college office takes good care of their students in the application process, as well as matching a student up to a good college for them. The family spirit of it is also well intact and fostered through activities and events held by the administration and parents of the students. The types of classes provided are also quite good, although their quality in actuality may fluctuate.', ""I like my classes. All of my classes are rigorous enough in order to prepare me and help me attain the skills necessary to succeed in college.

This includes nominations for extracurricular programs and college classes that can be taken outside of the school."", ""I'm still in freshman year, and I've been here since 6th grade. The school and academics are good in itself. The teachers are very passionate about what they teach compared to a lot of other schools I've heard of. It's honestly what you make of it. It's a hard school to be quite frank. The people here, aren't exactly the best and I've been involved in too much drama from 6th to 9th grade. Homework is not too hard or long if you manage your time well. This is a school where you can very easily get involved with the community, however, not many kids do. It's quite hard to be independent here, but you honestly can be if you try. But yeah, be aware of these things. You can take Columbia courses though, only if you're eligible and you have REALLY good grades. The dean is strict on the uniform policy, which is annoying. The girl's basketball team was cut off which really sucks, and the only sports that are really focused on are the boy's basketball, and the rugby team. Review by: Alyssa R.P"", ""Overall I have greatly enjoyed my time at BSU and feel that it has prepared me for college in ways that I didn't expect."", ""I went to this school for seven years (middle school and high school) and I can say for sure that they prepared me for college. Their curriculum is STEM heavy, with engineering (with computer science), science, math, and technology all four years. The only thing I have to say is that their music and art curriculum is a little lacking. But there are still art opportunities! There is a musical production every year that takes a whole semester to prepare for. After school there are a number of clubs and electives for every interest (I enjoyed Video Game Club!). We even have a garden, complete with live chickens! College preparedness begins  near the end of your Junior year; I was so ready that I had my college application finished before November, thanks to the college counselors. The teachers are great here, open for help (many of them have office hours). The workload might be tough at first, but it's nothing that students can handle. I will miss the school when I leave for college."", 'As far as New York City schools go, Columbia Secondary School for Math, Science and Engineering is a good school. You are given many opportunities as a student ,like the option to take classes at Columbia University, and there are no shortage in the amount of extra-curriculars you can take. This school also has a large emphasis on rugby and on STEM. The only problems with this school are that it is still young and can be very unorganized at times and also is very competitive with a heavy work load. However Overall it is a really good school and there is always something to do.', 'I really like the diversity at Columbia Secondary School. I’ve gained friends from all around the world from just being in school. Our academics are really good too because we have courses that challenge us beyond the average grade level that we are in.', ""My experience at CSS is very different. There are many highs and lows about the school, just like any other school. But overall, academically, the teachers do the best that they can do to educate us, and  the students recognize that, even if we don't push ourselves to do our best. However, many of the students find CSS challenging due to the workload. But we're all up for the challenge, otherwise we would not be at CSS. CSS is a great school, and should be recognized more for being a great school instead of some of the things that have happened in the past at CSS."", 'I attended CSS for 7 years,and it was quite a unique experience for me.  I felt that the school prepared me well as I go to college in the fall, with both the teachers and the ability to take classes at Columbia University to get a vibe of how college classes are. The school does have some variety of clubs and sports offered for students, but not as extensive compared to other schools,mostly since we share the building with 2 other schools so times for practices and games are limited.', ""CSS prepared me for college and encouraged me to apply to multiple colleges so I'd have a range of options."", ""I attended CSS  from 6th all the way to 12th grade, and was quite happy with my experience.  For its incredible diversity, strong sense of community, and challenging academics, I'd highly recommend CSS. Being able to take CU classes in my later years was a great opportunity, and the small grade sizes always meant that teachers built personal relationships with their students. All that being said, CSS is definitely not a typical selective NYC magnet school, and if that is the experience you're looking for I'd recommend against CSS. The school lacks proper funding, as evident by the cramped hallways and lack of a library, and the sense of competition found at schools like Bronx Science or Stuyvesant is completely absent.  That isn't to say CSS isn't difficult   if you want it to be - its just that the core curriculum (and administration) never push students too far our of their comfort zone. Overall, I'd definitely recommend the school."", ""It was very stressful at times, but the school does prepare the students for college. The school doesn't get much funding, and the administration can be frustrating at times, but it prepares the students for their next steps. Although small, the school has a big sense of community. Columbia Secondary is diverse, and holds events appreciating every bodies culture."", 'I do not hold any grudges towards Columbia Secondary School and am very grateful for the time I had there. The access to various college course options were tremendously helpful and the college office takes good care of their students in the application process, as well as matching a student up to a good college for them.

The reason I did not give the school a five out of five is because it is a collaborative school but they don't implement that for the students assignments and general work very well, they still do it better than other schools though.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

This environment than helps individuals thrive in the learning process of uncovering the challenging Honors and AP courses to which the school, and its students strive to achieve new heights within it.

The resources and facilities are very good, especially considering the school is based in a wealthier area. It feels like a safe school, but I think its secluded location and small size lessens the amount of possible danger. As someone who came in from elsewhere, I would say that the school is poor in comparison to what it could be. I would recommend working harder to build up school spirit in any way possible because at the moment it is extremely poor.

Cold Spring Harbor High School for me is where I learned how to learn, where I learned who I was as a person, and where I learned how to make the friends that have helped me further become a better person. Unlike other schools Cold Spring Harbor's commitment to excellency and uniquely small neighborhood feel helps to establish a learning community within it. This environment than helps individuals thrive in the learning process of uncovering the challenging Honors and AP courses to which the school, and its students strive to achieve new heights within it.

The school has a small student body of 160 per class with a large school campus in an affluent suberb setting. Graduates go on to top schools including the Ivies and Service Academies with 99% college placement. About 20% go on to top 20 schools in the country.

There is awful diversity on multiple different levels. Everyone comes from around the same socio-economic background, there is very little representation of different races and ethnicities. From what I can tell, their academics are excellent, with a plethora of AP's and honors classes. The resources and facilities are very good, especially considering the school is based in a wealthier area. It feels like a safe school, but I think its secluded location and small size lessens the amount of possible danger. As someone who came in from elsewhere, I would say that the school is poor in comparison to what it could be. I would recommend working harder to build up school spirit in any way possible because at the moment it is extremely poor. I would also try to improve the framework of the administration because I feel like its weakness spreads to other areas of the school."", 'Cold Spring Harbor is a welcoming community with strong qualities.

Another one is GSA or LGBTQ+ club, it welcomes students who are or not out and allies. Something I would like to see change is the teachers.

Most teachers here encourage all students to challenge themselves, and from this teachers are more involved in their harder classes. I also recommend to take the challenging classes here at Highland Park High School. I would say Highland Park is overall a good school with a welcoming atmosphere despite its small school size. My experience of Highland Park High School is not comparable to any other high school because of the small community, although, I believe because of its size there is more an emphasis on the student, and bettering the individual.', 'Highland Park High School is small, so people, including the staff, know each other. However, since it is small, class selection can be limited(variety), and friend groups are formed from way back.', 'Highland Park High School is small, and has all the benefits and drawbacks associated with its size. The school community is tight and all the students and teachers know each other, but the academic resources are limited. Larger schools offer more classes, and Highland Park lacks this variety. However, thanks to the variety of clubs in the school, students can learn engineering, acting, and philosophy at robotics club, the school play, and Philosophy Club.', 'Since Highland Park High School is a small school, students and teachers become really close. Teachers , advisors and counselors are able to focus on each student, enabling students to find their passion and what they want to become in the future.  Students and teachers have close relationships with each other which makes the school community act like a family.  HPHS also offers challenging classes (AP) which would help the students in college. Clubs and other group activities are also fun and encouraged.  Last but not the least, HPHS has strong sports teams! Go OWLS!', 'Highland Park is a diverse community which fosters acceptance and understanding of other cultures and communities.', ""The scheduling is a lot better and more thought out than my last school. The size is very small so it's basically a private school although it is public. There isn't a wide range of options for Ap classes however."", ""HPHS is a very diverse facility with different types of students/teachers. The student to teacher ratio is beneficial to fulfilling the students' needs."", ""Principal is kind of power tripping. School board refuses to fund or approve field trips with the exception of a few specific clubs (the music department has not gone on a field trip since spring 2014). Superintendent doesn't delay openings when necessary, making the journey to school hazardous on occasion."", 'I like the open lunch privilege that upperclassmen are able to take advantage of. I like how many of the teachers are easily accessible if students need help or guidance. I like the environment of HPHS, as the school is very small, so everyone knows each other.', ""Highland Park High School is great for students because of it's small size. This eliminates a lot of the horrid popularity contest culture in most high schools. The school is full of wonderful teachers."", 'I love the diversity of Highland Park High School. All of my classmates come from different backgrounds, either racially, financially, religiously, or culturally. The student body has a wide variety of interests represented by many student-run clubs.Perhaps we could use more resources for books and sports uniforms. The music department is also in need of better facilities and instruments. And I would love to see more language options in the future-- at the current moment, our school only offers Spanish and French. Overall, Highland Park is a great place to receive a high school education.', ""Highland Park High School is a very small, tight-knit school. Everyone knew each other and it was easy to make friends. My school is incredibly accepting; we were the first school in our county to adopt the Transgender Policy. I'm proud to be a member of this school, everyone was such a forward thinker. The only reason I don't give this school a full five-star rating is because there wasn't much variety in courses offered. Since it was such a small school, they couldn't offer many classes because there aren't enough students. It would have been nice to maybe take a European history class or a Piano 101 class."", 'I had an overall very positive academic environment at this school, and I learned a great amount especially from my AP courses, which helped prepare me for college workload.', 'HPHS participates in the sports that most schools do, but do not have a swim team, lacross team, and just formed a volleyball and winter track team. Two of the most popular clubs are Model UN/Congress and DECA. A good portion of the student body, especially those who are academically outstanding, participate in either of these clubs. Other clubs include the art club, math league, and the various science leagues, battle of the books, newspaper, environmental club, SAGA, etc.', ""I moved to a different town in 8th grade, so I had to start all over and make new friends. HPHS is very unique because the culture of the town is different and also because the school is very small. The student body consists of roughly 500 students. I run cross country, track, participate in Model UN/Congress, Mathletes, Battle of the Books, and orchestra. It is a very nice environment to learn. Some rooms don't have AC in the spring, so that's a bummer. There's a library across from the school so the location is also very convenient."", 'There are a few excellent teachers at my school, and also a few that are not that great. I have a history teacher who is very passionate not only about US history, but also about world politics and international relations. He heads the Model United Nations/Congress club in our school. My spanish teacher a great teacher as well, but is a bit biased, and it is very obvious to us students in class. Our marketing teacher is new, and she copies her textbook onto a powerpoint, and we copy the powerpoint into our notes. It is not really an engaging class, nor do we learn about marketing and business in depth. Overall, I would give my teachers a good rating.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Each teacher has their own teaching styles, however most are knowledgable in their field and are able to implant this knowledge into the minds of the students in effective and innovative ways. Communication and remaining on top of grading can be an issue at times, so it is usually up to the student to reach out and be very keen on notifying their teachers of any issues that may arise. In addition the teachers are very involved in the students activities and enjoy taking part in fundraisers and genuinely take interest in each students pursuits and well being. Teachers often take on multiple roles such as class advisors and sports coaches, etc. Also, because the school is so small, each individual has the opportunity to develop a close knit relationship with their teachers. The teachers are always available to offer support and make sure this is known among the students.', 'In this school the administration claims to have strict rules regarding the tolerance of bullying, and the students are fully aware that this is not completely true and do not take such things seriously because there are never incidents of bullying so we do not find that it is necessary. In addition, this is a very safe environment for students with a fairly competent school nurse. Also the school has an officer present in the building at all times,not as a result of an issue, just to further ensure the safety of the students. The students have grown to become friendly toward Officer Joe.', ""I learn a lot in school, but sometimes that comes from self-teaching. In general, however, teachers are very available and I learn in depth about all the courses I've taken. The workload has not been too heavy lately."", ""I feel safe, though there aren't many safety measures enforced.

I never go to the nurse so I have no knowledge of the topic, but from what I understand the health programs are ok at HPHS."", ""Save for a few, overall most teachers are excellent. They really seem to care about the students, their education, and their futures, as well as the subject they are teaching. They aren't all extremely extremely knowledgable, but they all carry their classes pretty well."", 'There is a wide range of extracurricular opportunities, though being such a small school, it is still lacking some.', 'The club variety is very limited, and not a lot of clubs get decent funding.', ""The main unique thing about this school is it's size.

The teachers are extremely helpful and want all their students to succeed. There are also numerous amounts of extra curricular activities to get involved in."", 'I love my experience at Highland Park High! I had an experience with a lot of bad schools in the past so once I came to HP, the idea of going to school and interacting with my peers scared the living daylights out of me. But, the students and staff were so welcoming and kind and even when I tried to shut them down and tell them ""I don\'t do well with interaction"", they still made an effort to bring this amazing part of me that I had forgotten about or hadn\'t even known I had to begin with. I came into HPHS a shy, scared, depressed little girl with no friends and no idea what she was going to do tomorrow, let alone for the rest of her life. Now, 2 years later, I\'m a blossoming, cheerful, energetic, ambitious young woman who would make friends with the entire human population if I could. The students really are allowed to get involved in their school and really feel like their concerns are being adressed, and I love that. I love that the school is small, and everyone is so close knit. One could get a family-like vibe from the student body and school really does feel like my home away from home, and that\'s what I feel a school should really feel like.', ""Highland Park High School has been a pretty good experience. The smallness of both its size and numbers keep the community more close-knit. Most of the people I will be graduating with, I have known since kindergarten, or even preschool. Its extreme diversity is really unique, and sustains the school as an overall welcoming environment. I've learned a lot, and made amazing friends I hope to stay close with as long as I can. All ideas are welcomed at HPHS, and there are so many ways you can get involved with the community and those around you. So many students are extremely talented in a wide array of activities, in addition to very passionate about them. I would choose to go to this school again if I could do it all over because it provided me with many opportunities and ultimately allowed me to make the friends I have today."", ""It's a small school where every student in the school knows each other or at least have talked to one another in several occasions. People are very friendly and supportive. There's a racial diversity where students from one race respect one from the other.

Suffern High School offers several Finance related courses, however it is my perception such courses are underfunded, understaffed, and given less attention than they deserve.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""I have had two boys graduate and one more to go.

Now let's talk about the horrible... They have many horrible people working for them that should be fired and not made to work with children ever again, people who let students be picked on for no reason except for their own enjoyment. I had a math teacher for example who couldn't do math, and he has a degree in the subject. Myself and other people from his other classes would correct his calculations because he got them wrong. And when you did correct him he wouldn't care. These are his own math equations and he literally wouldn't care that he was giving out wrong answers to his students.

Because of the smallness, if you're committed to a club, by your senior year there's a good chance you can take a big role or a leadership position. There isn't as a big a range of ECs as a big school would have, but anything you can't find within the building can be found in the area via a Google search. My one complaint would be with the guidance department. Depending on which counselor you get, you either luck out or are at disadvantage applying to college, getting schedules, getting internships, getting employment.

Many girls in the school also participate in the Glen Ridge Girl's Club, which is also a wonderful expereince I highly reccomend.

I did however participate in the music program under Mr. Lagos, and it was an experience that helped me grow as a musician and as a person.

The Theatre program had a new director this year who did pretty well considering the students were expecting our old director who we knew and loved, but nonetheless this program will go on strong as well. The academics at this school are pretty good, but the only issue is that the 12th grade English classes are limited. There is no 12th grade honors English class, only the choice of AP Lang, AP Lit, and college prep.

That being said, it's hard to imagine a high school experience much different from the one I've had. I don't think I'm unique in saying that I hated almost all of school while I was living it, but now, upon entering my last semester here, I have fond memories. I was exposed to racial and political diversity at places other than my school, so I think some classmates of mine are really lacking that experience."", ""Every teacher is different, that's for sure.

The faculty and staff are very nice and supportive. They genuinely care about students' lives and wellbeing. There is a great variety of extracurricular programs. The school's sports and music program are fairly competitive. I liked how diverse the student body is (race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, etc.). Though the facilities are not the greatest, the school felt very safe and homey."", 'Great school, with close family like atmosphere.  Not too big, teachers are all great, helpful and easily approachable.  Many sport and activities to get involved with.', ""Students feel welcome with clubs and sports at the school. Teachers always put 110% effort to help students voice their ideas on for better learning. Students can also join clubs such as school drama, dance club and trivia club. These help students destress themselves, and prepare them for careers in the arts and other areas. By knowing everyone's name, the administrators create a more personal experience for the students. In addition, the guidance counselors are very helpful in helping students destress themselves with the sometimes overwhelming amount of work. However, they  rarely give the help needed for college applications. The coaches train students mentally. For example, if players are playing unfairly, our players are taught to not retaliate and continue playing."", 'Parsippany high school was a very diverse environment and I had great memories. I wish they prepared me with college and the real world.', ""As a senior at Parsippany High School, I have watched it both grow in some aspects and deteriorate in others over the last four years. While we do have some amazing programs such as our National Championship winning Marching Band, and our Student Council, which is ranked one of the largest in the state, other programs seem to be failing. Our football team has been on a downward spiral for years now, but this season we've hit rock bottom, winning zero games. Our food is also a conflict, due to the fact that the company we use only has to meet a quota of a certain percentage of real meat in their chicken, the rest is bi-product.  Despite some flaws, the staff at Par High is incredible and our principal is absolutely amazing, he knows everyone's name and is always there for the students. The AP and Honors level courses really help with college readiness, and the extensive amount of clubs and sports that are offered are sure to boost resumes."", 'Not the worst school but not the best... teachers are very helpful but the workload is tough to manage at times. lots of changes to get involved in extracurriculars.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

The education is excellent, and the extracurricular are as good as most private schools.

Between the location and teachers, my high school experience couldn't have been better. The teachers and staff have truly helped me grow as a student and individual through my four years and helped me to succeed in the areas where I had difficulties. One thing that did lack was diversity."", ""My overall experience with RFH was pretty good. There are a lot of things the staff and administration gets right, but there's glaring issues that they seem to overlook. This often has to do with the teachers, some staff members should definitely not be employed for such a job. But the most irritating thing that I found with RFH is its rules are often based around the exception. Cell phone policies & homecoming are just two examples of how the administration made a choice because of an exception and the the whole student body."", 'RFH is a phenomenal school because it prepares you for college and beyond. The school has such a high grade average, that I believed a 3.67 was not good enough at the time. Because of this, something that could be improved for RFH is the overall prep for the real world. It is not a diverse school, so providing more opportunities in clubs and after school activities would be great.', 'I loved my expirence at Rumson Fair Haven. I was an athlete there and got to experience the wonderful sports they had. I also got to expirence their high level academic classes, especially the sciences. RFH had a wide variety of ap and honors courses available so any student could challenge themselves if they wanted. The teacher and community at RFH was super welcoming and I enjoyed the past 4 years there a lot.', 'The academics are very rigorous and it allows students to be looked at by colleges that they may not have the option of going to if they went to other high schools. The rules around the school are a little unnecessary and don’t always make sense though. Good kids get in trouble over nothing at times.', 'I moved to the area the summer before freshman year. It was a completely new area where I did not know anyone. Overall, it was probably the best thing that could ever happen to me. I was able to get an amazing education where at the end of the four years, I felt that I was 100% ready for what college had to bring. RFH was a place where I met some of my best friends that I was able to grow with over that time. Never in my mind did I think that I would love high school as much after hearing horror stories from others. I had such a positive and uplifting experience after going to RFH.', 'I love how RFH is a super tight-knit community, everyone knows everyone, and the teachers get to know you as well and you aren’t just a number to them. The sense of school spirit everyone has is amazing, and at the football games everyone is united in cheering for the team. The academics are good, but guidance tends to push you to take less AP/honors than you are capable of.  The only things I would change are to upgrade the technology since my teachers couldn’t get the computers to work half the time and to have more lunch options. The school stresses eating healthy for sports and stuff meanwhile the only choices are pizza, french fries, and an entire snack bar consisting of overpriced bags of chips.', 'Small, blue ribbon school. Lots of great professors who were willing to help. Beautiful area right near the river and ocean. Friendly staff and students.', 'The sports are incredible, the community is close and everyone comes together to support the school!', 'The school is located in a family friendly neighborhood and presents a comfortable sense of community.  The academics and teachers thoroughly prepare the students for college.   Less is done for those pursuing other post graduation options, such as vocational training or year off employment internships.  I would like to have seen more effort by the administration in fostering some type of buddy system to help shy students become involved by having someone to attend extra curricular activities and social events.', ""I liked how much of a family RFH is. Teachers know your siblings if they went through the high school, they know about each student's sports, and they are always available to academic assistance. If I could see anything change it would be for the school to improve the administration's relationship with the students."", 'I liked the sense of pride everyone has who atttends the school. Knowing every person you pass by is incomparable and help maintain a positive social experience. The teachers at RFH are very invested in the students and put forth an effort that I cannot imagine many others are willing to. The only change I would suggest is lessoning the workload because while our teachers care about our learning, some don’t take into consideration how much work we receive from other classes.', 'Rumson Fair Haven Regional High School has excellent academics with teachers who truly care about the curriculum.

One thing that did lack was diversity."", ""My overall experience with RFH was pretty good. There are a lot of things the staff and administration gets right, but there's glaring issues that they seem to overlook. This often has to do with the teachers, some staff members should definitely not be employed for such a job. But the most irritating thing that I found with RFH is its rules are often based around the exception. Cell phone policies & homecoming are just two examples of how the administration made a choice because of an exception and the the whole student body."", 'RFH is a phenomenal school because it prepares you for college and beyond. The school has such a high grade average, that I believed a 3.67 was not good enough at the time. Because of this, something that could be improved for RFH is the overall prep for the real world. It is not a diverse school, so providing more opportunities in clubs and after school activities would be great.', 'I loved my expirence at Rumson Fair Haven. I was an athlete there and got to experience the wonderful sports they had. I also got to expirence their high level academic classes, especially the sciences.

The rules around the school are a little unnecessary and don’t always make sense though. Good kids get in trouble over nothing at times.', 'I moved to the area the summer before freshman year. It was a completely new area where I did not know anyone. Overall, it was probably the best thing that could ever happen to me. I was able to get an amazing education where at the end of the four years, I felt that I was 100% ready for what college had to bring. RFH was a place where I met some of my best friends that I was able to grow with over that time. Never in my mind did I think that I would love high school as much after hearing horror stories from others. I had such a positive and uplifting experience after going to RFH.', 'I love how RFH is a super tight-knit community, everyone knows everyone, and the teachers get to know you as well and you aren’t just a number to them. The sense of school spirit everyone has is amazing, and at the football games everyone is united in cheering for the team. The academics are good, but guidance tends to push you to take less AP/honors than you are capable of.  The only things I would change are to upgrade the technology since my teachers couldn’t get the computers to work half the time and to have more lunch options. The school stresses eating healthy for sports and stuff meanwhile the only choices are pizza, french fries, and an entire snack bar consisting of overpriced bags of chips.', 'Small, blue ribbon school. Lots of great professors who were willing to help. Beautiful area right near the river and ocean. Friendly staff and students.', 'The sports are incredible, the community is close and everyone comes together to support the school!', 'The school is located in a family friendly neighborhood and presents a comfortable sense of community.  The academics and teachers thoroughly prepare the students for college.   Less is done for those pursuing other post graduation options, such as vocational training or year off employment internships.  I would like to have seen more effort by the administration in fostering some type of buddy system to help shy students become involved by having someone to attend extra curricular activities and social events.', ""I liked how much of a family RFH is. Teachers know your siblings if they went through the high school, they know about each student's sports, and they are always available to academic assistance. If I could see anything change it would be for the school to improve the administration's relationship with the students."", 'I liked the sense of pride everyone has who atttends the school. Knowing every person you pass by is incomparable and help maintain a positive social experience.

Your experience at North is what you make of it. If you're struggling with a class, attend an extra help or get peer tutoring. Joining clubs is also a great way to meet new people.

Just added a senior lounge too which is actually pretty cool because now the seniors had another place to hang out and be with friends in a relaxed environment.

The school is extremely cliquey and, coming from the city where diversity is huge, the student body seems awfully white.

With the help of the great teachers and kids I pushed myself to limits I wouldn't believe were possible. The great staff and people accompany the outstanding atmosphere."", ""My experience was very smooth and easy going. Environment is very nice with friendly people that are always ready to help. One of the best high schools to go to. I wouldn't really change much."", 'At my High School, Lynbrook Senior High School, all the teachers are very interested in you and your life and do anything they can to help you succeed the best way you can. I am a visual learning and most teachers will sit with me and show me visually what im learning so that i can grasp it better.', 'LHS has been a good experience. Some teachers are better than others and the you learn nothing in AP classes and just fail. ', ""There are various clubs including GSA, an award winning newspaper, cooking, Spanish, Italian, poetry, and others. They are all supervised by staff members. If you don't like any of the clubs available, students are allowed to get some friends, and one staff member to start up a new club."", ""I would choose this school again because the students and faculty made coming from another town very easy. The people were very approachable and finding people to talk to was relatively easy. This school is unique because everyone seems to care about everyone. There's no discrimination between jocks, actors/actresses, artists, etc. Everyone has friends with a variety of interests. Athletes aren't only friends with athletes and so on."", ""I think the staff at this school does a truly remarkable job at trying to get their students to understand the content. They give extra help hours that are very flexible. All of the teachers I have ever encountered have never let a struggling student in any of my classes just slide. They always try to help them out, even if they don't want it and don't really seem to care.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['The workload is usually manageable but sometimes teachers need to coordinate more with each other.', ""Sometimes the school gets too involved in the student's life"", 'For the most part, everyone joins the cliche teams like football, lacrosse and kickline', ""For a small school, LHS has a lot of school spirit.

It provides excellent education programs and out of school extra curriculum activities. If there was one thing I would change it would be the time when the first period begins. I understand that it is for the bus schedules so they can get the middle and elementary schools in too, but when you have some students waking up at five thirty in the morning it can lead to a lot of damge over time.', 'I like how teachers put in effort to see us succeed, and I like that they always prepare us for state tests.

The group I was apart of actually received the rank of ""honorable mention"" for our work. If students wanted to continue their passion for science, they may take the class, Advanced Science Research, where students will actually learn about how to properly conduct research. Students then enter competitions that require extensive research that offer scholarships like Intel\'s Science Talent Search. Our alumni were finalists in the nation-wide competition.Although JFK brings a lot of academic growth to its students, the students themselves develop strong bonds and form cliques that are hard to socially reform.', ""I'm an international student, it's fairly good so far, kind of hard to meet people, don't know if it's me or them..."", ""Overall, my son's experience has been positive.

Negatives:-The school itself is very small and due for some renovating. -The bus system for Edgewater students is still very circuitous and messy.-Although there are sports teams and Leonia apparel, there is absolutely no school spirit. No pep rallies, cheerleaders, students don't really attend games to support their team."", 'It is a very high level school. The teachers and Counselors are extremely responsible and respectable.

It's place that you don't need to close yourself off and be shy, there is this warmth presence that you'll feel when you walk in, in the mornings. Teachers are with you every step of the way, if you stumble they will give you a helping hand and pull you up to speed. They always want their students to be the best, making learning virtually simple, disguising it as something else. They push their student ahead, ultimately making high school a highlight in life. "", ""Most of the teachers are well prepared and teach very well.

The most popular club or organization is the ""Limelighters"" which is the drama play staff organization. They enjoy and prepare everything for plays after school.', ""What I liked the most about Leonia high school was that there isn't any discrimination or racist. When I was attending another school as my first time in the US, I was very disappointed with the discrimination by the teachers along with the students. Unlike the people at the school which gave me a bad memory that still stays in my mind, the teachers and students at Leonia high school respect each other and never discriminate somebody. If I had to go to school again, I would definitely attend Leonia high school."", ""Most of the teachers at Leonia high school are very friendly, kind and respectful. They always respect their students, listen to their stories and ideas. They help the students who are struggling with the teacher's subject and when even it is not their subject. Also, they move around in classrooms to ask each student if they have any questions or any concerns. When they give the students quizzes or tests, they always give the students review sheets before the test day and go over everything with the students. They are eager to help students with extra help and they even come to school earlier than they do usually to help students in morning. Every teacher has their own rubric of grading system and keep their consistency in grading.

Infinity Institute,"['The togetherness of this school is amazing. Since it is a small population school, everyone essentially knows each other. When passing by in the hallways, people of both student and faculty are greeted constantly. When at lunch, students are mingling, enjoying their time together.', 'They undeniably hold up to academic standards, offering their students the best and ensuring that they are prepared for college. This is currently the second best high school in the city and cannot be shunned for having up to date technology and resources for students. Moreover the school possess a diverse student body and acknowledged such through multiple assemblies on an annual basis. The school is EXTREMELY involved in the community and offered a lot of volunteering opportunities for all students. Now i must say, the food that is fed to the students is really bad. moreover, they have a very limited spectrum of school clubs, partially because of the small student body. Additionally, because the school is fairly recent, they have no sport and students have to travel to their home public high schools in order to play sports.', 'I am a sophomore at Infinity Institute which is a high-school/middle-school. It is overall a very academic school with very smart and friendly peers surrounding you. We grow off of one another, helping each other in the process of doing so. What I would like to see in the future is the expansion of sports and after-school programs.', ""Every class is an Honors class, so it was always challenging and engaging. Infinity Institute is on par with McNair High School, the only thing is that it's pretty new still. The teachers are friendly and care about us, and the school is pretty small so we know each other more and every student is taken care of individually by the teachers."", 'The school has some great teachers while some others completely miss the mark. However the teachers dedicated to education truly make a difference in the lives of their students.', 'The last three years of my high school life have been very experimental and it gave me an opportunity to experience another way of life through many different types of people and various working environments.', 'Best school ever! I rate this a 5-star because: One, Infinity Institute gave me a big opportunity to get into the best Ivy-league colleges after my senior year. Two, there might be a 98% chance I might enter in either a High Honors, Honors, or an AP class.Three, since me and three of my besties are going to the same school next year, there is ALSO an opportunity we might enter to Harvard, Columbia, Yale, or Princeton University! Together!All I could say is that this school is one of the top best schools in Jersey City AND New Jersey! :)', 'The administration treats you like a middle schooler, which Infinity does have. The math department is excellent however this school does provide any types of opportunities and preparation for college', 'I wish that there would be more involvement with all of the students, in each and every grade, and less focus on certain grade levels. I also would like to see more programs that interest the majority of the students, rather than small portions.', ""Can't say that it's a breeze to get buy, but most teachers will present tests and quizzes without teaching the prior information presented on said tests and quizzes"", 'The food here is practically disgusting, I have a picture of a mouse caught in a glue trap right beside my locker. The health teacher cut out all good and necessary foods of the school. This cut fundraising for things like bake sales and candy shops. This also cut the side shop in the cafeteria where people could buy food other than the rubbish that was served. The nurse does a well job at taking care of their students. Students do not even bother to eat at school, because the lunch is disgusting and there are no other options to choose from', 'Only few select clubs are good, and the ones that are good do not last long. We had drone club for a good month, but it was cut due to lack of funding for the teachers participating in it', 'The school is very small, even when it is a highschool mixed in with a middle school. The staff are very strict, with harsh consequences being implemented for nearly every minor infraction. For instance, if a student forgets to wear their student ID, they will be struck with a Saturday detention, also for wearing a sweater that is colored other than black or white. This restricts students harshly, and there is not much that this school gives back for their students. All fundraisers done do not go towards the students. We were promised sports equipment 3 years ago, but that never happened and we are the only high school in Jersey City without a sports team.', 'A few cherry picked teachers, mostly the math department, are the ones that genuinely care about their students and what they learn. All teachers one way or another incorporate technology into class with smartboards, laptops, and websites that assist the teacher with teaching the class. The physical education department is not great at all, because students do not learn much when the teacher is absent for half of all classes, or when an excuse is maid so students will not be able to play in the gym, which is unfortunately also our auditorium', 'The academics is generally very great and manageable. Students here tend to learn more than the average student. A lot of emphasis is placed on knowing the subject matter, as all classes are either honors courses or treated as such. The curriculum follows that of the state and district and covers most of everything required. The workload receives mixed reviews. Many feel that the workload is much too great, with it requiring a lot of dedicated time. I, speaking only for myself, rarely ever have an issue where the workload seems overbearing, but that can be attributed to a different work ethic. Unfortunately, with the school being as small as it is, the number of available classes is limited, so most students end up taking the same classes, due to a limited number of electives, although there still is a rather diverse course path for many students.', ""The school is very safe. Upon entering the school, one must go through a security check involving metal detectors and a non-invasive possessions check by security guards (they only require looking into a student's backpack and do not go through all of the student's personal belongings). The school is small and only requires a very small security staff, however the staff is very prominent. All security guards are also unarmed. All visitors must sign in upon entering and leaving. Security cameras are present in all hallways and stairwells, with few located on the building's exterior, but absent from classrooms. Staff and students require ID, however this rule is very lax as the small number of students makes everybody recognizable without an ID. All exits can be locked internally and all but the main entrance usually are. Fire alarms are present throughout the building, as well as a PA system. There are also anonymous bullying report forms present throughout the building, should they need to be used. As per physical safety, the school leaves very little room, if any, for error."", ""The school lacks most extracurricular activities. Sports are only available to the middle school, as of this moment. All high school athletics must be done at a student's home school (the school closest to their address that does not have a restrictive acceptance standard). The clubs that are available are limited. The YMCA hosts daily after school activities and anybody may sign up. Clubs that are available are the creative writing club, where students may write for the school magazine, chess club, where students may play chess or learn, French club and Honors Society, for students interested in activities related to the French language and culture, National Honors Society, for the high achieving students (there's no shortage of members), after school band rehearsals, and the many after school labs, such as algebra and biology among others, where students may receive homework help or simply review with a teacher and other students without the limitations of the normal classroom environment. The school could definitely use more activities, but those are uncertain to come without additional funding and approval from the district."", ""The great thing about this school is that it's fairly new and fairly small. While this does have its downsides, such as a lack of established programs and funding, it also works in students' favor. The small community of under 300 students, both middle school and high school kids, make's the community very tight-knit, where almost everybody knows each other. Since the school is fairly young, we don't have many established activities, such as athletic activities for the high school or a large number of clubs and classes, AP or otherwise, but this means that the students can actively shape the future of the school and evolve alongside it. The students are, for the most part, very intelligent and friendly, meaning the environment is very welcoming and the academics can move a great pace. The reason I would go this school again is because without it I wouldn't be the person I am today. Infinity did me a great service by putting me in an environment where my appreciation for learning was rekindled, after burning out in the years prior due to an underwhelming and somewhat superficial experience in the previous grades. The supportive and thoughtful staff, who have done a great job at making the atmosphere feel inclusive, and the wonderful students, many of whom I am glad to call friends, made the experience worthwhile. If I had the opportunity to go back in time and redo my high school years at Infinity, I definitely would. It would give me the opportunity to capitalize on all of the things I never took advantage of, and hopefully, make my experience, and myself, better than it already is."", ""Most teachers at the school are great teachers. They are able to teach the subject matter effectively and give many lessons. There are the few times where teachers are forced to give work that may not be entirely related to the subject and may seem to be 'busy work' but that is a rule (an unpopular one) set by the administration. Teachers are also very knowledgeable in the subjects they teach, providing additional information if anything, rather than the bare minimum to get by. Most teachers are also available to help students after school hours, which is a great help to those willing to make sure they understand the subject matter in a less restricted environment. Overall, the teachers at this school know what they are doing and will only ever get sidetracked due to mandatory administrative policies.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,,,

Made a lot of great friends and memories, and helped with a lot of SAT/ACT preparation.

They could use some additional parking. all sports fields now have brand new turf.', 'Nyack is a well-rounded school with plenty of opportunities to succeed academically for those who want to.

There were some teachers that were simply there to relive high school, however other teachers were genuinely good and nice teachers. The students can be wild but most of them are there to learn and see their friends. The sports are average, as well are the clubs. The only thing that kind of sucked was that everyone had lunch at the same time. It was too hectic.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['What was nice about Nyack High School was the diversity and facility members involved within the school.
