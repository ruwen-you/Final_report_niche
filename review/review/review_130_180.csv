Glen Rock High School,"[""Glen Rock High School will hold some of my fondest memories, and some very harsh opinions. I loved my time there, with the school's closely knit community and focus on balancing academics and other activities. However, change is needed to maintain the school's reputation.1.) More dual-enrollment and science/technology classes MUST be offered.  Being a STEM major, I have friends who went to schools that had a ton of these classes. They're all able to take only 1 more class in order to get a Minor because of the DE classes they took. They also know how to code, weld, work on cars, etc.2.) Change the post-HS perception. College is NOT meant for everyone. Some people are better suited to go to a trade school or starting their own venture. Seeing how many people dropped out of college at the end of freshman year confirms this."", 'Glen Rock High School is a good school. The teachers are either great or not so great The majority of the teachers want to see their students succeed, however, their are some that are relying on their tenure. As a sports player, I know that the school invests most of its money into sports related things. This is bad because a lot of other clubs are not properly funded and result with a lack of student participation.', 'Great faculty that genuinely cares about its students. Although, school needs to be more involved and focused on helping students choose a career path prior to university.', 'Glen Rock High School has a good foundation but has some room to grow. Departments are either very strong or weak with no in between. Additionally, some teachers truly care, while others do not. There also seems to be no basis curriculum, so teachers for the same subject vary greatly difficulty wise. It is a nice small town and it is nice that everyone knows your name, so it is hard to feel unnoticed or forgotten about. This could be both a good or bad thing. You always have people looking out for you, but you have no privacy.', 'This school is average. There are some good things, and some bad things. There are some good teachers, but a lot of them are not good and do not teach you or try to explain. The classes are challenging but good. The school cares too much about sports to care much about academic activities. They don\'t really address any of the major problems, like drug use and vaping and just talk about how ""Bullying hurts people\'s feelings"". I would give it a lower grade if the classes didn\'t make up for all the problems', 'I love how there are always opportunities around my school to get involved in my community and to help others.', ""The education is very advanced they have multiple of classes, but there isn't a diversity of students. We are considered a blue ribbon school. The classrooms are high equipped. If you ever need help with something you can always stay after school for help teachers are willing to help. In sports we are really good in soccer."", 'Glen Rock High School is known as a great academic school. I’ve found that the teachers are hit or miss- I’ve had some amazing teachers that help their class succeed and make the subject interesting and teachers that don’t care about the students and know they’re safe because of tenure. The school tends to spend a lot of money on football and somewhat unnecessary school related things (Schoology being one of them). Many other smaller sports and clubs don’t get proper funding. The guidance department is a MESS. Some kids are alright, some aren’t great, but that’s typical with high school. Overall GRHS isn’t an awful school, but not one I really enjoy going to everyday.', 'I very much liked the way the teachers prepared us for college. They challenged us, but not too much where we could not succeed. As a student I struggled a little bit in some of the courses I took and everyone wanted to see me succeed. I went to my teachers for help and when that did not suffice, the principal even offered to tutor me in that subject because it had been a subject he had taught before. The one thing Glen Rock High School needs to work on is making sure their teachers are not over-qualified for the jobs they hold. Some teachers are extremely intelligent, but when they teach the students it can be hard to understand what they are trying to teach. If the teachers are able to simplify their lessons to make sure the students understand, Glen Rock High School would be perfect for every student.', ""For a public high school, I left with a great education, but I also left happy that I would never have to go to that school again. Probably your typical privileged upper class homogenous white high school: Looks safe and welcoming from the outside, but brings oppression and aggravates mental health issues of those who are considered different (not white, not cisgender, not heterosexual, not culturally American, etc.) The school has a wonderful educational system, but like many other high schools in America, they need to take their student's concerns more seriously and address systematic oppression and micro aggressions immediately so that students can learn to live as adults in a world that looks a lot different than their high school, and appreciate those differences with an open mind."", 'Teachers cant teach nor care to.  Kids suffer for it. Never help students who need it.  Admin. Hides behind their tenure.  Sports good. Clubs good.  Kids nice. Parents casting.', 'My experience was alright.

I loved my time there, with the school's closely knit community and focus on balancing academics and other activities. However, change is needed to maintain the school's reputation.1.) More dual-enrollment and science/technology classes MUST be offered.  Being a STEM major, I have friends who went to schools that had a ton of these classes. They're all able to take only 1 more class in order to get a Minor because of the DE classes they took. They also know how to code, weld, work on cars, etc.2.) Change the post-HS perception.

I’ve found that the teachers are hit or miss- I’ve had some amazing teachers that help their class succeed and make the subject interesting and teachers that don’t care about the students and know they’re safe because of tenure. The school tends to spend a lot of money on football and somewhat unnecessary school related things (Schoology being one of them). Many other smaller sports and clubs don’t get proper funding. The guidance department is a MESS. Some kids are alright, some aren’t great, but that’s typical with high school.

They challenged us, but not too much where we could not succeed. As a student I struggled a little bit in some of the courses I took and everyone wanted to see me succeed. I went to my teachers for help and when that did not suffice, the principal even offered to tutor me in that subject because it had been a subject he had taught before. The one thing Glen Rock High School needs to work on is making sure their teachers are not over-qualified for the jobs they hold. Some teachers are extremely intelligent, but when they teach the students it can be hard to understand what they are trying to teach. If the teachers are able to simplify their lessons to make sure the students understand, Glen Rock High School would be perfect for every student.', ""For a public high school, I left with a great education, but I also left happy that I would never have to go to that school again.

One issue that I had was that tests/quizzes were piled onto one day which made it stressful for students to study for multiple exams. Additionally, projects were also stacked on top of each other and due on the same day-- talk about missing sleep! However, this all prepared me for college when I look back at it.

Jokes aside: the school while having a great teaching staff and I had an overall great relationship with my teachers I can say that most of them have a notion of how students should act and behave and are harsh when they see even slight outliers to that. In its self, though that wouldn't be a problem, the issue is that there is very little consistency for what is right and wrong.Furthermore, the teachers and the school have no understanding, once scheduling a physics test the day of the SAT. Moreover, if you're not satisfied with a grade your screwed as there is very interest in the teachers in helping you boost your grade even if it wrecks your GPA.

However, what made me choose 5 stars was the fact that my school listens to what they students really want. For example, late this year, before the end of the school year, there was a lot of news going around about school shootings. My school and the students from the school demanded and took action. By the end of the school year, there were rules in place of which doors to leave from, and even police officers came to our school everyday to watch after the school.

I enjoy working with some of the teachers and how they go out of their way to help you if they see you're not doing well. I find this school to have a very live ambient at its sporting events, specifically soccer games. It gets even better with the rivalry we hold with the neighboring town of Westfield. Some of the negative things I've found in this school are that some teachers aren't supervised enough and aren't doing the best job at teaching their students. I had two teachers in my time who didn't teach much throughout the year or did the bare minimum, but when they had someone come in to supervise them mid-year, it's like they transformed into an actual teacher.

However, what made me choose 5 stars was the fact that my school listens to what they students really want. For example, late this year, before the end of the school year, there was a lot of news going around about school shootings. My school and the students from the school demanded and took action. By the end of the school year, there were rules in place of which doors to leave from, and even police officers came to our school everyday to watch after the school. I do not know if this will be permanent, but what made me think that my school stood out as an excellent school is how much the teacher care for the safety of their students."", ""As a recent alumni of Scotch Plains-Fanwood Highschool, I often find myself reliving some of my favorite memories from highschool.

There are rarely any fights and you can always find a school safety officer.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Commack High School,"['The academics, teachers and policies of this school are great, along with the extracurricular activities, clubs and sports. Days are very reasonable and homework is too. Safety in the neighbourhood is guaranteed through the presence of great school security.', 'My experience at Commack High School has been tremendous. The variety of classes offered at the school are limitless. i have made countless friends and formed relationships that will last a lifetime. Nearly every teacher I have had has been extremely helpful, and is always willing to help with a problem I may have. The clubs offered also know no bounds, as I see hundreds of students staying after school daily for athletics, clubs, honor societies, and more.', ""Commack High School is one of those schools that focuses on what's important and somewhat ignores everything else. As I noted below, the school's programs, clubs, classes, and college preparedness are spectacular. In whatever I am doing at school, I enjoy my time and get a lot out of it. I have loved almost every one of my teachers, and my favorite part of the day is after school when I get to play sports or go to my clubs. the only issue I have is the quality of the minor things. The food is pretty bad, but there are a few gems. The worst is the facilities. Bathroom stalls have no doors and most of the water fountains don't work. Other than that, Commack is amazing in every way."", 'more diversity and less judgemental. also some students are very homophobic, xenophobic, and racist. but it has very good academic and amazing opportunities for students. for example, the school is an IB school and they can take the full diploma for credit', ""Commack high school was really a great school experience. Something that stands out between them and other high schools is that they make community service mandatory or you can join school sports and clubs to count as community service hours. I didn't realize it at the time but it is really great for when you are filling out college applications and you have been so involved in the community and school."", ""I love going to school here! The staff constantly tries to improve themselves everyday! Teachers always try their best to ensure every student gets the help they need. Unfortunately they are lacking in language, I loved taking German one, but I can't continue with the program because it was cancelled. They also offer every sport their division allows and encourages students to get involved."", 'I like all of the opportunities for getting involved in the school through academics, school clubs and sports.  There is a tremendous amount of support from faculty and fellow students.  The school should work on more communication with their students so that they are more aware of anything going on inside and outside the school during the school year.', ""Every high school has their ups and downs; Commack High School may be better than some. Commack really pushes their students to be the best, academically and in the aspect of volunteering. Many teachers are pretty nice and are always open to help kids out when they're struggling. With regards to clubs and sports, Commack has a wide variety of sports and oppurtunties to volunteer in the community. This really helps students in their last year of high school since they can add any experiences to their resume for college. They also have the oppurtunity to take part in internships, ranging from education to the health field. It really allows students to get a glimpse of their future before officially commiting. If there were some things I could change about Commack High School, it would be the ability to freely roam during homeroom so that students could actually get things done and adding a lounge area for students since most kids just sit on the floor before and after school,"", 'There are many advantages Commack High School offered that any student who attends could benefit from. As far as academics, I found it easy to enroll in classes that I was able to challenge myself, with that said, every teacher was eager to help me if I was struggling in any area. There is an overwhelming sense of school spirit, as even the teachers dress up for spirit week.', ""The teachers and resources at the school are very good and lead to a positive learning environment. The equipment for learning activities and PE are suitable. Students tend to form groups and aren't very willing to include others. Drugs and vaping have become a problem and are widespread. A large majority of the school vapes and this has destroyed the bathroom. Most of the students are middle upper class, white, and either Jewish or Catholic. Food is bad."", 'Large school but has lots of opportunities for students to get involved and work with others in the community', 'Commack High School provides a great education for all of their students in a safe environment. The teachers and staff were always very helpful and always making sure that each and everyone of their students were successful in the class. If there could be one change to the High School I would wish for more electives to be added in because I find that these make school more interesting and it helps people find out more about a profession.', 'This is my forth year at Commack High School. Overall, this has been a positive experience for me. There are many things you can do here, like clubs, honor societies, and sports, and the possibilities are endless. They also have an excellent music program as well. I feel very prepared for college in the future as the administration is always there to help. I will definitely remember my amazing experience at Commack High School.', 'Most teachers are truly wonderful and really want their student to succeed. Administration, on the other hand, is a wildly different story. Despite offering a number of ways for student to voice their complaints, they are continuously ignored and dismissed. The large family of crickets living in the walls could use some work too.', 'The school prepares you well for college with their curriculum, IB classes and college credit classes. It has a great varsity program in many sports. The teachers care about the students. There are many social activities and events for the students.', 'Over the course of my high school years,I have enjoyed participating in clubs and college level classes. Particularly, I enjoyed setting up for school events with my classmates in the Class Of 2020 clubs. It has taught me how to build upon my teamwork and communication skills. Although not every school is outstanding , I personally believe that Commack High School has provided me with amazing opportunities, and certainly thousands of connections everyday. I couldn’t be more proud of my school, and I will continue taking many clubs throughout college.', ""I liked how engaged and friendly the teachers are and how they understand the pressures and chaos of a high school student's life. I wish the school offered more AP classes to make it easier to earn college credits rather than the much lesser known IB courses."", 'I only gave it a four star because, first off. They just took away some electives that are art related and some people like me need these electives such as fashion design to further experience what it’s like and an alibi for college.

Nearly every teacher I have had has been extremely helpful, and is always willing to help with a problem I may have. The clubs offered also know no bounds, as I see hundreds of students staying after school daily for athletics, clubs, honor societies, and more.', ""Commack High School is one of those schools that focuses on what's important and somewhat ignores everything else. As I noted below, the school's programs, clubs, classes, and college preparedness are spectacular. In whatever I am doing at school, I enjoy my time and get a lot out of it. I have loved almost every one of my teachers, and my favorite part of the day is after school when I get to play sports or go to my clubs. the only issue I have is the quality of the minor things. The food is pretty bad, but there are a few gems. The worst is the facilities. Bathroom stalls have no doors and most of the water fountains don't work. Other than that, Commack is amazing in every way."", 'more diversity and less judgemental. also some students are very homophobic, xenophobic, and racist. but it has very good academic and amazing opportunities for students. for example, the school is an IB school and they can take the full diploma for credit', ""Commack high school was really a great school experience. Something that stands out between them and other high schools is that they make community service mandatory or you can join school sports and clubs to count as community service hours.

Commack really pushes their students to be the best, academically and in the aspect of volunteering. Many teachers are pretty nice and are always open to help kids out when they're struggling. With regards to clubs and sports, Commack has a wide variety of sports and oppurtunties to volunteer in the community. This really helps students in their last year of high school since they can add any experiences to their resume for college. They also have the oppurtunity to take part in internships, ranging from education to the health field. It really allows students to get a glimpse of their future before officially commiting.

Students are very competitive, which can be beneficial because it raises the standards in SSHS.

However, I feel that the school does not offer enough options for the students who do not wish to pursue this track. I wish that there were more AP classes available for those not interested in IB. The emphasis on the IB diploma makes students who are not enrolled in the full diploma program feel less intelligent than their classmates, which is not only unfortunate, it is wholly untrue.', ""I really like South Side, for a high school it wasn't necessarily a horrible experience. However, the lack of diversity is troublesome, and there is definitely a competitiveness to the school. College ready-ness and a focus on sending children to college sort of eclipses a comfortable learning environment. South Side loves to push kids, which works well for some and causes others a lot of trouble."", 'The teachers are good, includes both IB and AP courses. Most students take full IB courses which are extremely difficult but good preparation for the future. New construction recently done which has made the school bigger and given it much more resources. Students are all hard workers, very judgmental towards those who do not excel in most classes. Large variety of extracurricular activities. Do provide multiple opportunities to take out of country trips to Spain, England, France and more. One of the best public schools on Long Island with a very high regarded name.

The school nurses make sure every student is feeling well and is taken care of- but also makes sure no one is faking an illness to get out of class. Students who suffer from diabetes or other health conditions feel welcomed by the nurses, who are very friendly and approachable in all situations. I personally always feel safe in school, with security guards and security cameras I never feel vulnerable. In addition to this, the school is strict about people leaving the school and coming inside of the school."", ""There is an abundance of extracurricular activities, such as Red and Blue, clubs, and sports. A high majority of students take place in at least two of these activities, whether it's playing an after school sport, or participating in Theatre.

Somers Senior High School,"[""The school has a mental health crisis and covers it up and provides minimal help for students who are suffering. The competitive nature creatures an unsafe environment and students do not feel comfortable enough to share ideas. The school recently hired people that wear vests, use walkies and patrol the hallways. It makes the campus feel like a prison since most students are not allowed out of the building at any point during the day. These patrolling people also sit outside of bathrooms, making it uncomfortable and intrusive for students. Teachers either don't care at all or take personal pleasure from students suffering academically. I have never been somewhere so unwelcoming and isolating. I can't wait to never come back to this place. If you have a child who is already feeling anxious and isolated, DO NOT bring them here."", ""I don't love school, but it was an overall good school.  I wish it was more diverse like some of the neighboring districts.  Parents were sometime overly involved.  The grounds are nicely kept and some of the fields were kept nice.

Granted, the school has its setbacks. For example, funding goes into unneeded areas and lacks in needed areas. For example, the arts department could certainly use a new kiln and paint, but meanwhile there are flat-screen TV's being installed in the cafeteria in the lobby and an extremely expensive scoreboard being installed in the gymnasium. Scheduling is also a big issue, since many classes get in the way of others.

Unlike many other schools I've been to (I've attended 7 different ones), the entire student body is really nice, and we rarely have issues with the teaching staff and administration. And as of this school year, we were ranked a Blue Ribbon school, one of around 300 top schools in the nation!"", 'Good communication on important issues and events  diverse classes and electives good sport programs', 'At Clarke H.S the staff and faculty are all about the kids that go there. There sports program is the best around and music & arts programs are top notch!', 'Though small and poorly funded, the community at Clarke is close and well-meaning. The teachers truly want the best for their students, whether they need emotional help or extra tutoring.', ""Clarke has many opportunities to join classes and/or clubs that fit with one's future career plans. They have many AP courses and Dual Enrollment classes which allows one to receive college credit at participating universities. They really try to get as many people involved in the school as possible. Although they don't currently have advanced security measures such as metal detectors and bag checks, Clarke still manages to be and feel like a safe environment."", 'This school is a small and safe school to attend. It is an amazing school for the class that they have and the teachers will want to help you do better.', 'Going to this high school has been an okay experience. Academics are ok, but there is more of a focus towards art and music, which not all students would prefer. Students themselves are very clique based and if you are new, it may be difficult to make friends. The facilities are okay, though they could use updating. Resources could also use updating, such as technology and curriculum. Did prepare me for college though. Overall, Clarke High School  was an average experience.', ""Clarke has always been such a great school in the begginning, freshman year could get hard because you're finding yourself, seeing whos still your friends and what not, but after you find your crowd it's good. We have a lot of clubs and sports for students to participate in. Teachers are usually good with their students. Party life is pretty bad tho there's rarely any parties"", 'All around good. Very good in the main cirricular department but a lot of the electives are taught by teachers who know little to nothing on the subject.', 'All the after school activities and ability to take challenging courses. I have attended to this school for the last 4 years and love the environment and the opportunities offered. I took 5 AP courses and 10 Honor classes.', 'Very small school. You can find yourself in a friend group or you cannot. Due to the size of the school it is quite hard for some to fit in. Also there is not a wide variety of teachers or clubs to participate in. However, if you do find things that you would like , going to this school will be fun.', ""Clarke High School was definitely a safe environment when it comes to bullying and things of that nature. No one really faced situations like that. What I loved is that we are a very diverse school. Teacher wise, there were some really great professors and some that weren't so great.  The guidance counselors were okay but I didn't find them too helpful. One thing that I would love to see change are the AP Classes offered. I wish Clarke offered more AP classes. However, due to us being a small school it becomes difficult to get a full class and causes some classes to not run."", 'Throughout my four years at Clarke High School, my grades were high, but my self-esteem and overall well being were not. Overall, the teachers had much passion about their classes, but they did not consider that students receive work from other classes and have extracurricular activities when assigning their workloads. This led to much stress and unhappiness regarding many of my classes (obviously with exceptions) and learning overall. The addition of the Common Core curriculum certainly only contributed to this feeling of negativity and it should be known that it does not at all improve the learning experience. The music program and its teachers are outstanding. The athletics programs are decent, however slightly under-budgeted. This school needs a full-size running-track. The quality of water from the fountains needs much improvement, including the quality of food coming from the cafeteria. Clarke High School offers many superb opportunities, but has some changes it could make.', 'Dedicated teachers and staff for the most part, but there are definitely some things that the school turns a blind eye to.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Clarke High School is a blue ribbon school.

Although the halls may be crowded in certain areas, it is the experience that you get with Midwood, as it is about the size of a small college.

There isn't one class I've sat in where it's 100% white or black kids. Every class you walk into, there is a mixture of students whether it be white,asian,black,middle eastern, literally anything you can think of. The diversity factor here is important because not many high schools are like that. One thing I would change however is the staff. The staff here are very unorganized and last minute especially when it comes to planning events or trips."", 'Midwood High School is great for students whom are serious about pursuing something in the medical field, as many of the AP classes they offer are generally for these students but Midwood does offer other fun courses for student not pursing in the sciences as well.', 'I remember I was very excited when I got news that I got into Midwood.

What I would like to see changed is that the school offers more activities to get students to involve in hands-on learning.', 'Midwood high is an amazing school. To me it’s my second home, it’s a place I spend almost half of my day at. We have knowledgeable and nice teachers here who are always there to answer any questions you have, very supportive guidance counselors.

Very little space to walk during class changes in the hallway!', 'my experience at Midwood High School was very good. The teachers were excellent at there job, and if you needed help the help was always available.', 'Midwood High School is a very diverse place. Midwood tries to keep the students in a safe environment while the students explore their interests through classes or afterschool activities such as clubs. However, Midwood does not focus on helping students choose their career path/major for college or offer a large variety of classes that differs from the core classes (english, math, science, etc).']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['The diversity in the school is so amazing and unique.

You could tell the teachers really knew what they were talking about as they have all had years of experience prior to entering the school. The sporting events were just as fun! There was always a good sense of comradery and school spirit at these events. Being in marching band, one of the most crazy and fun things to do is go to the football games for that type of energy.

I was told that the OHS moms have their own little clique too? Not too sure about that but they were said to have a Facebook page where they bash peoples children and sometimes talk about the parents; talk about moms of the year lol. The school lunch is okay, we have a boars head station which is really popular with the students but most upper class students go out for Lunch since we have an off- campus policy.  There are teachers and guidance counselors who really care here. The bathrooms should be cleaned more often as there is usually stalls without toilet paper which leads to long lines in the bathroom.', 'Oceanside High School did a great job allowing kids to express themselves the way they please to and bullying was never tolerated.

There are plenty of resources for students who may be struggling academically or personally. OHS offers an array of clubs, such as the Thespians, DECA, WIC, the Sider Press, Video Production club, and many more. I'd recommend joining Oceanside Model Congress. Each teacher at OHS is unique; they can be great, terrible, or weird (either in a good and bad way). There is an LGBTQ community in the school, and bullying is not really a problem. Most people in OHS belong to a clique. Students of OHS, particularly seniors, follow several traditions like attending football games. The school district keeps its students safe by mandating that all students and personnel wear IDs whenever on school grounds. OHS has the highest rate of vaping of all the high schools in Nassau County. There is a degree of nepotism, as the School Board, the PTA, and the Teacher’s Union compete for influence within the district."", 'i believe oceanside high school one of the best in nassau county but should bring back its riffle team', 'The best part about this school is the Math Department.

Some teachers have inefficient methods of teaching, making it hard for students to understand, they should be evaluated more often.

It was nice to know u had a team of people supporting you . However the school is majorly over crowded. Due to this overcrowding many students do not get the help they need to . The programs sometimes lack structure in what they are teaching . For  instance I was in the law program and due to teachers leaving or being fired we didn’t learn much about law . Overall I had a good experience but to be in this school you have to learn to be independent and not rely on anyone but yourself .', 'The guidance counselors have to manage a lot of students, and so the experience with them may not be personalized or be unable to get the assurance you need unless you know what you want (ex: college readiness, college search, career exploration, work).The school has good sports teams and art and music clubs. A lot of people slack during gym and there could be more activities to do during this time to really help people grow and develop good traits.

In this high school, there are many students. By many students, there are around 4,000+ students with many different ethnic backgrounds. Due to the amount of students in this school, students have a really hard time getting to class because of the crowded hallways. Try to avoid the second floor whenever possible. That floor is a nightmare when getting to class. Also, the school makes students attend school at different times. Freshman usually start later in the day and as you progress as a student, you start school earlier.', 'Francis Lewis High School is very diverse and offers many opportunities. However, one disadvantage is that the school is overly populated.', 'The school was way too crowded but That helped me make plenty of friends. Looking back at my experience there, I wish there were more opportunities for me to make new friends. However, I loved my teachers and I learned things I will never forget.', ""Francis Lewis is a great school that offers a lot of AP's, clubs, teams, and programs.

Few minor problems can be students that are misbehaving aren't being dealt with the school staffs."", 'While it is an amazing school with caring staff members, the overpopulation is absolutely insane.

There are many clubs and activities for the students such as chorus, sing, drama. There are also a lot of sports teams as well such as soccer, football, basketball, and wrestling. The arts program is average.', 'It was a good school. Although, the staff can be rude. If you want to get classes changed after the first 6 weeks of school, it is very difficult. Depending on who your AP teacher is, it will be a very easy or very hard class. It’s is a great location with many buses, but no train. There are many good places to enjoy food as well as AMC nearby.', 'Francis Lewis High School is an alright school. The academics and resources there are fine and the teachers there are by no means terrible. The biggest issue with the school comes as a result of how many students there are. Often times the amount of students would just make it so that the administration and some teachers are just unable to keep up with the demands of the student body so academics and guidance suffers. Overall, Francis Lewis High School is just an average high school that suffers from too many students.', 'At Francis Lewis High school, there are so many programs like law, forensics, science research, international relations and more that can help prepare you for college. The school is diverse and has many activities like jrotc, volleyball, basketball, and clubs that you can join as well. My experience so far at Francis Lewis has been pretty good and met new people and friend.', ""Overall, Francis Lewis High School is a great place to get your education and eventually your diploma. The students are without a doubt the best part of the school. I've been fortunate enough to meet some amazing friends during my 3 years at FLHS. Although there's more than 4,500 students, it's not hard at all to build relationships and find small communities within certain sectors of the school. Personally, I spend most of my time with my extra-curricular families (ie. the play production, string orchestra, journalism, etc.). I can confidently say that there's something for everyone at Francis Lewis. Coming in at a close second are the teachers of FLHS. The majority genuinely care about their students, both academically and as people. My biggest piece of advice for incoming freshman would be to get involved. Like I mentioned before, there's so many options; it's pretty much impossible to be excluded. Don't be shy!"", 'I mostly enjoyed my time at Francis Lewis High School. The school offers many programs for students to join, and has many courses to sign up for such as AP classes. Outside of class you can join clubs and/or sport teams after school. Gripes I do have with this school are the maintenance and the spacing. In one of my classrooms this past year, the ceiling’s a bit collapsed and has leaked water until the custodian has decided to patch it up. Also the spacing, as many people know it, has always been a problem among students especially on the 2nd floor. Overall, if you can look past the overcrowding and subpar maintenance , then the programs and teachers this schools offers is fine.', ""What can you say about the most overcrowded high school in Queens. The staff are overwhelmed and parents and administration bend the rules to get Title I and don't know the students. It is a  brutal 4 years and worst of all, college admissions are bleak with most going to mediocre schools.

Every grade has several exclusive cliques. The girls are very judgmental and fake, and most of the guys are just jerks.

I have had outstanding teachers, especially during junior year, and I have learned a lot in the past three years. One of my favorite learning experiences was my freshman World History Honors class. My history teacher was the best that I ever had, and although the workload was much more than I was used to, the knowledge that I gained from that class--both historically and currently--set the tone for the rest of my high school academic career.\r I know I am receiving a good education, but the actions of other students frequently hinder my opinion of my high school. Many students here are ignorant or rude; there are only a few that I know I can trust. Students here do not reach out to help others automatically. If they do, they do it so that they can benefit themselves. My friend once told me about a freshman boy on crutches, struggling to hold all his books. He subsequently dropped them in the middle of a crowded hallway, yet no one stopped to help him; she was the only one who approached him and aided him. The fact that something as simple as helping someone who is injured is overlooked bothers me greatly about the student body. I have also heard some offensive things over the years, especially about the LGBTQ+ community and other ethnic and racial minorities.\r Despite the academic excellence that I have experienced, I would not choose Governor Livingston High School again if I could do it all over; the students that attend the school are ignorant, bigoted, and selfish.

The Music Department is incredible, and the instructor is extremely talented and gifted. I would highly recommend the music courses present at Marlboro. What should change in Marlboro is having an air conditioning system be installed so that in the warmer months everyone is comfortable.', 'Marlboro High School is an engaging and interactive learning environment with experienced, caring staff.

It also often places its priorities in unnecessary places, such as funding one particular sport while other activities can rarely obtain any new equipment.

Even at schools with strong college and career readiness, there may be students who are not getting the opportunities they need to succeed."", ""Since I'm a senior at Parsippany Hills High School I learned a lot throughout the years. From learning computer programming to college readiness, I would say that this school is very well-rounded in the sense that you are getting a quality education from an urban high school. I would like to see some changes in the facilities and some more help with college readiness. I feel like there should be a semester course or something like a class or such that does help prepare us better for college and what's ahead."", 'I liked the faculty and the guidance staff. All have been very helpful as I prepare for college. I also enjoy the variety of courses one can take as a student. There are endless electives and several classes per subject.', ""I love that teachers are so passionate about their jobs and are willing to help a student in need. They are accommodating to everyone's needs and make school a safe learning space for kids. They prepare their students for the real world, especially college. I thought I would be overwhelmed with the college work load but having a high school that takes its studies seriously, I was very prepared. The student body was also extremely diverse which helped me interact with new people from different cultures."", 'I think the schools is okay but the main issue is that they don’t give enough importance to some sports. Tennis, for example. The tennis courts are in horrible condition with cracks,  hole and plants growing out everywhere.', 'Above average education-- excellent teachers. Tightening security is good, but some measures leave students wondering if they have any freedom left.', 'I really think that Parsippany Hills, and even just the Parsippany School District is very good. It is a good community with a good environment and the schools only add to that. The teachers and administration are positive and I think that they truly care about the students at their school. I would add a few more classes just so that everyone has something that they want to take, every year. I would especially add American Sign Language as a class and I am honestly surprised that PHHS does not already offer it. I think that course would be a great learning experience and provide even more diversity and inclusion to the school.', 'I liked the student aspect of Parsippany hills high school. The teachers do not  ignore their students,they take the time to teach them and help them out whenever the student is struggling. Furthermore, they do not disregard the concerns of the students and they actually try to find ways to solve the problems.The part that I would recommend needed to be changed is the control of the school. It can be sometimes too controlling like signing into the bathrooms or staying in the school. It does not allow for a lot of room to feel that you are free.', ""I think the school is nice but it is lack of diversity.I've had a hard time at that school mainly because it is hard to find a lot of people who look like me and who come from my culture.

I've had a hard time at that school mainly because it is hard to find a lot of people who look like me and who come from my culture. Also, it's ability for the counselors to empathize with the students is kind of sad. Instead of offering actual help, they just scare you into not coming forward with anything. This really needs to be worked on."", ""I have nothing bad to say about this school because I had a wonderful and memorable experience. The only thing I wish was different was my classmates, but that is not the school's fault. Some people were just more mature than others."", 'I’ve had a very successful high school academic career.

Many students have an opportunity to participate on one or more sports teams, definitely for track. Best sports (with winning seasons) include Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Cross Country, Track, Softball, and Baseball. Worst sports: Soccer, Lacrosse and Tennis.  Athletic facilities are pretty bad, Soccer/Lacrosse field is located at the other side of town on a patch of grass, while the turf located at the school is not regulation size for many of the sports. No track, Tennis Courts are at the nearby college, yet has access to a great aqueduct for Cross Country runners. School Spirit is pretty good, usually for basketball, volleyball and football (at most 10 students support other sports games).', ""DFHS has multiple sports and clubs for students to participate in. There are positives and negatives to being such a small school for these clubs and sports. Due to lack of numbers, most of the sports teams do not have cuts, with players getting lots of playing time, and can always join track if not getting playing time in other sports. However most sports teams are used to losing seasons simply because there are not enough bodies. The girls soccer team won one game the entire season, for example. The football team usually wins games simply because their schedule has worse and smaller teams than Dobbs does. Basketball, Cross Country, and Volleyball, however, always have good programs. All in all, students are generally happy with the teams they participate  in. Clubs are pretty good at Dobbs, but like most other schools, they are as good as the students make it, reach out and get active. Students are also able to start their own clubs that interest them as long as a teacher is available. I started the FUNdraising club, another student started the international club, and another started a video game club. There is always a cub students can join, such as Wilderness Club, Activities Branch, Rat Pack, Dance Team, Feminist Club, etc. The commitment levels of most clubs are fairy low. Most will meet once a month, while others meet weekly. I am a representative in Legislative Branch, where commitment is strong with weekly meetings, however only four students per grade are admitted. Multiple clubs also fund raise for various charities, something very rewarding. For example, The FUNdraising club raised enough money to feed four families in a year through the organization Blessings in a Backpack, Feminist Club raised $150 for women shelters, and Legislative Branch raised $1,500 for a local Children's hospital; something I am personally proud to have a school so committed to raising money to help others. Overall, I think DFHS has a solid list of extracurricular for students."", 'Our science department is absolutely amazing, but that is not a correct description for all of the departments.

AP is a much easier and more logical system, and most students wish this was in place and not the overrated IB.', 'I generally have had a great experience with all of my teachers. Definitely better relationships that worse. They care that we understand the curriculum and work with us if we do not. We have a great teacher-student relationships simply because we are a small school, where each teacher has the opportunity to know each of their students. I can only think f 3 teachers that students complain about, and the two that I have had I enjoyed having them.', 'DFHS has a strong tradition and value to sports teams, especially compared to rival schools. Many students have an opportunity to participate on one or more sports teams, definitely for track. Best sports (with winning seasons) include Football, Basketball, Volleyball, Cross Country, Track, Softball, and Baseball. Worst sports: Soccer, Lacrosse and Tennis.  Athletic facilities are pretty bad, Soccer/Lacrosse field is located at the other side of town on a patch of grass, while the turf located at the school is not regulation size for many of the sports. No track, Tennis Courts are at the nearby college, yet has access to a great aqueduct for Cross Country runners. School Spirit is pretty good, usually for basketball, volleyball and football (at most 10 students support other sports games).', ""DFHS has multiple sports and clubs for students to participate in. There are positives and negatives to being such a small school for these clubs and sports. Due to lack of numbers, most of the sports teams do not have cuts, with players getting lots of playing time, and can always join track if not getting playing time in other sports. However most sports teams are used to losing seasons simply because there are not enough bodies. The girls soccer team won one game the entire season, for example. The football team usually wins games simply because their schedule has worse and smaller teams than Dobbs does. Basketball, Cross Country, and Volleyball, however, always have good programs. All in all, students are generally happy with the teams they participate  in. Clubs are pretty good at Dobbs, but like most other schools, they are as good as the students make it, reach out and get active. Students are also able to start their own clubs that interest them as long as a teacher is available. I started the FUNdraising club, another student started the international club, and another started a video game club. There is always a cub students can join, such as Wilderness Club, Activities Branch, Rat Pack, Dance Team, Feminist Club, etc. The commitment levels of most clubs are fairy low. Most will meet once a month, while others meet weekly. I am a representative in Legislative Branch, where commitment is strong with weekly meetings, however only four students per grade are admitted. Multiple clubs also fund raise for various charities, something very rewarding. For example, The FUNdraising club raised enough money to feed four families in a year through the organization Blessings in a Backpack, Feminist Club raised $150 for women shelters, and Legislative Branch raised $1,500 for a local Children's hospital; something I am personally proud to have a school so committed to raising money to help others. Overall, I think DFHS has a solid list of extracurricular for students."", 'Our science department is absolutely amazing, but that is not a correct description for all of the departments. Our weakest one is math, which I personally find very troubling. Both the English and Social Studies departments are mixed in skill, some teachers are excellent while others are terrible. Most seem very interested in their topics. They are consistent in their habits of grading.', 'My school has a variety of club options, some of which need a lot of commitment and others almost none. The school seems to favor sports; they get the most funding and are very popular. Our music program is budding, but under funded.', 'I have enjoyed my time at Dobbs.  Sure, there are some downsides; The same few families sit at the top of the Dobbs hierarchy.  Yet, despite this, Dobbs has its advantages.  The IB Program at Dobbs is as rigorous as any high school program in the country.  The teachers are extremely knowledgeable.  The students are awesome and fun.  The sports teams are great and everyone gets involved.  The school is diverse, both economically and ethnically.  If I had to do it all over again, I would (even though it would be a lot of work).', ""The computers are perfectly accessible.  The parking is not available to students, so you have to park on the adjacent streets, which is perfectly doable.  It's just inconvenient."", 'The cafeteria food is not good.  Especially the hot lunch options.  Luckily, the cold sandwich and salad bar is ok.  In addition, the school lets students eat out for lunch, so students get to eat out at the various restaurants and shops in downtown Dobbs and the surrounding area.  A favorite spot of mine is Battaglia Brothers, which has absolutely fantastic sandwiches.', 'Ever since the new administration took over a few years ago, everything at the school has improved.  Before my freshman year, we got a new principal, superintendent, and school board president.  They have worked tirelessly to improve the high school.  Specifically, they completely changed the cafeteria, which at one point was one of the ugliest places in the school, and made it a place where students like to hang out.  My guidance counselor has been nothing but helpful, and the principal is the nicest guy in the world.', ""We here at Dobbs Ferry are really involved with the varsity sports teams.  Because the high school is so small, almost anyone with reasonable talent who is an upperclassmen can join the varsity team and gain an athletic experience.  Even if you're not on the team, the school spirit at Dobbs is exhilarating.  Most students attend games for all of the major sports teams, but football is what really excites Dobbs Ferry High School.  We have a tradition for having an excellent football team, and whether you like football or not it becomes a tradition to attend the weekly football game in the fall.  It's an enjoyable experience."", ""The school is very healthy and active.  There is little to no obesity within the school, and at the same time anorexia isn't a problem.  In terms of safety, we've never had any problems.  We have had a few lockdowns over the years, but mostly as precautionary measures. Bullying was a much larger problem at Dobbs Ferry Middle School than it is in high school, where everyone basically keeps to their self.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Pascack Valley High School,"['PV high school is the breeding ground for racist ,rude, privileged kids and parents. With bullying and constant harassment.

Teachers get to know their students very well, making the classroom feel safe and comfortable.', 'Pascack Valley high school is an excellent all around school. The counselor’s, teacher’s and administrators are there 100% to help with any situation your child may be dealing with. I have a senior and a sophomore attending PV and they are doing great. I am so grateful for the support and guidance they are receiving. I feel that my children are in a healthy and safe environment which puts me at ease everyday. These years in a child’s life are challenging and PV has met that challenge and I am so grateful to each and everyone of them.', ""PV is a pretty okay school depending on what you value. Academically, I have almost no complaints - although some teachers can seem like they have absolutely no idea what they're doing. There's a pretty decent variety of classes you can take, however I can think of some essential ones missing.     Academics aside, the rest of the school is meh. I think the culture can be pretty toxic. PV has scandal after scandal whether it involve white supremacy, rape, or whatever else. People who get involved with these things aren't punished at all. The school's not that diverse and is pretty much 90% white with a few Koreans and Latinx mixed in there. There are a lot of wealthy, sheltered, and privileged people.      I say as long as you surround yourself with the right people and make the most out of what the school has to offer, it'll be alright."", 'I appreciate that the school incorporates technology in the classroom. I think students should be better prepared for college. In addition, the faculty and the students are nice and I would recommend this school.', ""Where do I start. Pascack Valley is a great place to learn, while you are surrounded by great teachers, give or take a few bad ones. That's about it. The social life is average, just like any old high school. The thing that turns me off is the sports and clubs. I am a honor society member, I played football, basketball, and soccer throughout my stay and I hated every moment of it. Every since my freshman year, sports at PV went on a huge decline and the only successful sports teams were the girls basketball and softball, and boys baseball.

Patents have more influence over administrators than they should. Very entitled community.', 'Smithtown High School East is a great school for academics! Almost all of the teachers are highly qualified and do a good job at preparing their students. We have an excellent music program that has been very successful. They go on a minimum of one trip per year (performed at Carnegie Hall, Six Flags, Coney Island, etc.). We have some successful sports teams, but we are definitely not the best. As a senior, I believe I am extremely prepared academically for college, especially as a STEM major. Now for the negatives:There is not a lot of diversity especially in the school. Vaping has become an epidemic in the school. So much so that they closed almost all of the bathrooms in order to prevent vaping in the stalls. However, this has done absolutely nothing to reduce the amount of vaping and has only inconvenienced the students.

NYC iSchool,"[""It's basically a liberal arts institute without the amenities. The independence that is offered to students, whether it be the choice of courses or letting students explore into different disciplines and not restricting them with unnecessary requirements is what makes the school so appealing. The building is lacking, truth be told and we don't have the best facilities. But at the end of the day, we are one of the most diverse schools NYC has to offer. And certainly one of its best."", 'The NYC iSchool offers many great opportunities. Students are able to choose their own classes which creates an individualized high school experience.', 'This school is amazing. The teachers are very helpful and caring. The work students do is meaningful to them because they choose their courses, which makes them more engaged with what they learn. It prepares students for college through advisory and college prep meetings. The academics feel interesting and challenging. Aps are offered too. The administration put a lot of work into weekly emails that offer updates and program oppurtunities. You can go to anybody working here for help academically or emotionally. The people are also nice and supportive, and there are a bunch of clubs offered. The sports facilities are not too strong, seeing as there is a weight equipment room and a half gymnasium thats shared with the auditorium. Besides that, it is a great school in a great area.', ""After being at the school for 4 years, I have grown to love the NYC iSchool in all of it creative, weird, and unique qualities it displays. From the courses provided such as The Science of Yoga and Meditation and Happiness 101 to the amazing faculty and staff, I can confidently say that this school provided me with high school experience that's paralleled to none. The curriculum goes beyond testing a student's ability to memorize facts and formulas, but rather pushes students to think critically about the information they're taking in and make informed decisions about how they perceive the world around them. Each grade has support systems that will allow the student body to remain motivated and eager throughout their high school career. If I hadn't gone to this school in 9th grade, it's hard to envision my being the current person I am today."", ""I believe that this school is a very good school for students that want a diverse and smaller learning experience. This school isn't too big when it comes to student size. You are able to connect with teachers and they are always available to help you as they are flexible."", ""The academics at iSchool are truly great. The school offers a wide range of classes to challenge students in the best way. Personally, I really thrived in the academic environment at iSchool. The majority of the teachers are wonderful as well, always willing to help students. However, the administration isn't always as accommodating or kind, and the facilities are less than amazing."", ""I had an astounding experience at the NYC iSchool! The way that the modules intertwined DOE's academic curriculum and real-world issues is ingenious, and really serves for the non-contemporary student."", 'The NYC iSchool offers a unique high school experience for students. The curriculum in the courses allows students to break from the usual standard of teaching and allow them to think deeper on subjects in order to display ""mastery"" on that specific subject. One of the core beliefs of the iSchool is that a student\'s worth is not determined by a grade they receive, but on the work, they put in.', 'NYC iSchool prepares students to go to college very well and gets students ready for their future. The students are encouraged to attend programs outside of school, think critically, and do more than just school work. My one problem is there is a lack of clubs at school.', 'Throughout my four years at the NYC iSchool, I had nothing but positive thoughts about the school. The teachers truly care about each individual student and they want to help everyone be successful. The classes are tailored to meet the needs and interests of the students. I have felt the strong sense of community that bonds this school together. At the iSchool, the students are encouraged to work with each other and build off of one another. I have made a lot of friends throughout my time at the iSchool. Every time I have needed to talk with someone, whether it was my advisor, a teacher, or even another student, they have always made time to help me in any way they can. They are truly excellent resources to have as you move along your four years of high school and even start preparing for college. I can honestly say that the NYC iSchool has brought me the happiest four years of my life.', 'the administration is agreeably the most disappointing part of the school, diversity is low, otherwise a fantastic school', ""I love the iSchool. Great teachers, great admin, amazing opportunities, unique courses, diverse student body, student-led clubs, fantastic location, small close-knit environment. This school is home to students of all levels, from ivy league to liberal arts to community college students go everywhere. There is no 'one' ischool experience. Everyone takes different classes because there is a large emphasis on choice and individuality."", ""I have had an excellent experience at school so far. It varies so much from your typical high school. Students can pick their classes while still having core classes such as math, English, science, etc. This is the school for the student looking for something different. We don't have a big gym or have football games, but we are a very inclusive community looking to accept and embrace diversity. While it can be challenging being a minority student attending an excellent school, the school is very diverse, and even if you feel like you may not fit in, there are a variety of clubs."", 'I loved my experience at the iSchool a lot. The best part is all the amazing teachers here. They all care so much and are really good at their jobs. It is such a great community, and I really learned how to take control of my own education and be a self driven student. It is very clear that the students who are successful here are the students who want to be.', 'Overall, my experience at the NYC iSchool was enjoyable. One thing I loved is that the classes were unique, which made for an interesting hands-on learning experience. The teachers were amazing, and I always felt like we were on the same team. I was never intimidated or scared to ask for help because I knew they were on my side. If I could change one thing about the school, it would be our culture and traditions. Our school is very small and I feel like its the perfect size for a tight knit community, but the school spirit is very low and I feel as if I missed out on that throughout my high school experience.', 'The NYC iSchool is an amazing school where every student will work hard and do well for the time they are here. This schools offers a mastery policy, meaning you are allowed to retake tests and redo assignments until you show mastery in that subject area. Furthermore, this school offers an array of classes you can apply to, and some very unusual classes at that. Currently, I am learning about history through movies in a class called ""Reel Global History"", but last year, I took a class called ""Food Revolution"" in which we learned about nutrition and eating healthy, and even went down to our own garden in Battery park! One this I would change is how much work you get. Some students might be in shock in college especially because you are not required to take any AP classes in this school, and if you don\'t, you can have little to no work.', ""So far, my years at the NYC iSchool have been much better than I could have envisioned high school to be. The iSchool's uniqueness is what makes it stand out, in terms of allowing students to choose their classes and offer some classes to be taught by the students themselves through online classes. iSchool, however, doesn't  make me feel super prepared for college, as it does not give a lot of homework. While some people may feel thankful for not having much homework, it doesn't prepare us for the excessive studying and workload of college.. But the iSchool does a good job of providing programs and opportunities in addition to clubs and some sports."", ""Incredibly innovative high school. Perfect population size- close community, but you're often meeting new people or getting closer to acquaintances. The teachers are incredible! So dedicated, they listen to the students, and they put a lot of effort into creating engaging and impact classes. Our strongest departments are English and Science. Art and PE departments could be improved. The college office is one of the best of any high school I've seen, so helpful! Diversity isn't outstanding but the administration is making a huge effort to reach more prospective students of color. There are a lot of stairs but its worth it. I've had an amazing experience, I highly recommend it."", 'The teachers at the NYC iSchool are invested in you and your success. They are helpful resources for how to navigate high school and how to excel in higher-education. I feel that the structure of the iSchool prepared me very well for college. The modules gave me real world experiences that have influenced my studies in college and the freedom I had to choose my classes made the process of doing so in college much easier.', 'Such an amazing school, where you are treated as an individual. You will be taught how to be a citizen of the 21st century. You will also take a creative approach in obtaining problem-solving and critical thinking skills.

I wish that the sports teams were a bit more established, but that will come with time. The school soccer team just came into fruition recently. An excellent college ready program that helps students with the many parts of applying for college, be it financial aid, grades, recommendation letters, etc. The counselors make sure that every student is looked after with the time they need. The use of technology is unique as well, you don't have to be a tech wiz to go to this school. Just be familiar with Google Drive.

NYC iSchool helped develop me into the person I am today by allowing me to explore my interests in the module block, which is a section during the day where we take a class that we picked out of the course descriptions that deals with a problem the real world is currently facing.

In my four years at the NYC iSchool, I've exposed to many different ideas, forced to play devil's advocate with my beliefs and have become prepared for college and life outside of high school.

Thanks to this, it is absolutely normal to see seniors be friends with freshmen, always being supportive and guiding them through the iSchool ""ways"".Of course, all things can be improved, and if anything, the iSchool should strive to attain their own school building. In doing so, more than enough space is opened for more varsity sports, clubs and the sorts. Nonetheless, great school!', ""My experience in the iSchool has been a pleasant one. All four years that I've been there, they have been very supporting. The iSchool is very different from many other high schools, they give you more opportunities in your studies to get the grade you really want.

The teachers are extremely friendly and genuinely care for the well being of the students.  Their openness allows for close bonds to form, which in turn enable the students to do better in classes. The classes themselves were extremely interesting and these classes varied in topic and allowed the students to decide their own interests. The independence that iSchool offered me really helped me to become a confident young adult; I could experiment with different classes, set my own schedule, and reap the benefits of hard work. The relationships I formed with my teachers helped me to communicate better, both in employment and in regular social situations. This school had many clubs and had enough laptops for every student; even allowing laptops to be taken home overnight.

I have enjoyed the four years at this school and wouldnt change it for anything.', ""Its always a complicated but interesting story to tell when it comes to the NYC iSchool. Finding this school the first day was so difficult, since it shares a building with Chelsea, another highschool. After climbing 5 sets of stairs, you see familiar faces and administration who know your name. This highschool is like a small liberal arts college. You can choose your own classes and create clubs.

While these things are cool, maybe MOHS should focus a little more on getting enough chrome books so that teachers aren't scrambling to get chrome books carts for their classes.

Over the years  I have created a bond with some teachers where I can talk to them about concerns or problems and they will try to help me through it. One thing that I want to see a change in is how little attention the special needs program is given. I feel special education needs more opportunities for learning. Mount Olive had an amazing special education program but through the years it has been declining.', ""I felt that my time at Mount Olive High School was definitely not wasted. I personally feel that the wide array of class offered here at Mount Olive can cater to any individuals interests and needs. However the school is also very focused on sports and test scores of their students, instead of the academic success, and satisfaction of their students. Throughout the future Mount Olive High School should focus more so on how student are performing academically, and recognize what other clubs and activities, that aren't sports, have accomplished. Overall, Mount Olive is a great school, with outstanding facilities and teachers, and I believe will be a great place for future students to attend and excel.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"
