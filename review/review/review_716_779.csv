I wish I would have went to Passaic county tech or international high when I had the chance. I probably would have been better off at east side high.

I am an alumnus of the school and attended the school since middle school but throughout time, the school continued to grow with many advancements but there are negative outlooks. A large number of teachers choose to leave the school due to the fact that the students are not disciplined and parents continue to blame the teachers for failing grades. It is highly unorthodox for any school to introduce an ""intervention"" system which grants the student to retake an exam or failed assignment which students fail to use the system and fail for the semester at PCSST. It is highly noted that students excel from the academics and go on to attend popular universities such as Howard University or UCLA. The school fails to prepare students for college level courses which is very depressing due to the fact that many colleges do not tolerate the poor performance from their students.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Harlem Children's Zone Promise Academy II Charter School,"['I am a freshman at Promise Academy 2. I have been attending here since I was in the 3rd grade. My overall experience is amazing. There are so many opportunities the school provides it is amazing. Last year in 8th grade I was given the chance to take  Biology and Algebra. About 18 students and I took the regents for both courses and all passed. I am now a freshman taking Geometry and Earth science. This school gives us a multitude of opportunities to get ahead in our education. The programs are also amazing . From track , to volleyball, to basketball, the school has many fields of sports. Extracurricular activities do also include Music. I myself has been playing the flute at promise academy since 4th grade and I enjoy it. Overall, Promise Academy prepares all of its students and has a variety of opportunities.', 'I enjoyed my self while also learning different things that will help me in the future. If I had to change something it would be the library selection amount.', 'I feel as though I am not just learning inside the classroom at my school. I am learning outside the classroom too, from my fellow classmates who want to engage about the things we have learned. My school is my home away from home.', 'The school started off good when i came in for high school now it did a 360 and its not really doing well.', ""Many students complain about poor school lunch or our lack of privileges compared to other High Schools.  I can still honestly say that Promise Academy II is an amazing school.This school provides students with the resources needed to not only graduate High School but also find success at college. As a minority, it is evident that our problems only grow as we exit High School, but Promise Academy II prepares us for the real world. Programs are set into place and each students goes through a journey, finding their role both in and outside of school. However, Promise Academy II does have some poor attributes that can be fixed, its biggest being the fact that Promise Academy II tends to baby their students. They hold our hands all the way up until college, making it difficult for students to adjust to an atmosphere that doesn't  do the same.With a school filled with imperfections, lies a with a perfection in building students mentality as they find their own form of self worth."", ""At Promise Academy 1 is okay. I am a Sophmore going to a Junior. In school, there's a lot of stuff that needs to change. Starting with diversity. I get that they are trying to get African Americans to strive for greatness but that's not going to help, when I am in college and introduce to other people outside my race. Also safety may be low because we're in the middle of the projects but nothing drastic gas happen yet. Food is somewhat okay and could be better. Teachers are fine but they tend to stress a lot on athletics than studies. We don't even have a high school library. The teachers do look out for us, especially during out senior year but for this school to be greater they should add more people of a different races."", 'What I liked about Promise Academy II was the students recievd a lot of academic support. The teachers were there to help students with course work if they were having difficulty. What I would like to see change in that school is it needs to become more diverse. Diverse meaning their needs to be more students in the school that are of different race and ethnicity  other than African American.', 'My favorite thing about my school is that they give us a lot of opportunities. They expose us to many different environments, take us to look at colleges and give us help with anything we need. Whether we need help with getting job or fee waivers for taking standardized tests, Promise Academy II is a great help and has continued to show that they care about their students.', ""I would like to see a lot change. I feel that if a student is ready to graduate early then they should be allowed to, everything shouldn't be based of the donors or money. Lastly students shouldn't take classes if they aren't needed. They should be able to leave school early and enjoy their HS experience"", ""I have been going to Harlem Children Zone  Promise Academy 2 charter school since I have 5 years old and now I am 15 years old in my sophomore year. This school is a blessing, both teachers and students have helped me through every problem either academically or socially. This school as taught me that there's going to be someone there for you, trust me someone is alway going to be there to help you, you will never be or feel alone. I would recommend children in New York city to come to this school. This school will always be there for you even when your not I school."", 'Every teacher knows your name. You can never fail in this school because someone will help you get back on track . The class sizes are small. I wish the school was a bit more diverse though. The academics do not present a major challenge.

I was not challenged. There was no competition at this school and teachers barely teacher, most to all the teachers gave worksheets (wastes a lot of paper in a school year which makes me even sad) and not teach, I never learned from the teachers and I had to try to learn myself from khan academy or other resources which was very difficult.  The students fool around a lot, it is very easy to get a good grade in the school, I can say that I still worked for my grade but there are many students who ALWAYS  turn in work last minute and would probably get the same grade as me, which isn’t fair for me or the others because of this, standardized test scores like regents, SAT, APs scores are so low, the SAT AVG  many students had below 1000, and the majority had between 700-900 total SAT , 60s on regents, and a very low passing rate on APs. We barely get homework which is to finish CW, Band teacher was amazing though', 'I loved how involved the teachers were with their students whether it had to do with academics or things that were more personal.', 'I really like the bond the students have with the teachers. It’s a really small school with a small amount of students so people get that one on one with teachers when needed.', 'It has a big facility. A diversity of students and some welcoming teachers. Teachers get along with students. Not many sports the gym and auditorium are together. Some main science subject are gone such as chemistry. Not much about college readiness.few fights break out. There is a good amount of security through out the building. Some students are falling behind. Students may take online classes. Not many clubs in this school', 'What makes this school unique for me is the diversity with in it. The teachers of the school are one of the things that stood out to me the most. The teachers actually care about the students. Teachers are understanding on accepting late work and pushing back due dates and taking time out of their day to help students with numerous problems. The teachers try their best to get to know the students in their classes. Another thing that stood out to me from this school was the internship opportunities. Participating in an internship comes with many benefits. Having records of internships looks good on your resume, and stands out to colleges. In conclusion LSSS is a small school, and has very helpful teachers.There are no fights going on in the school, which makes it easier for the students to focus on their work, not on drama. Great principal! She’s very helpful and very good at taking feedback from the students to improve things in the school.', 'What makes this school unique for me was the experience it gave me. I really had fun at this school playing soccer with the team. Although we didn’t win as much, we enjoyed it and supported one another. It felt like everyone was connected. I don’t think there will be something like this at another high school because for me i made a lot of friends and we would often go play outside school.', 'The school provides many opportunities to further your future career with clubs, competitions, and trips. This school is very liberal and open, which I like very much. There is no discrimination between students. Students are open to everyone and everything and it allow students to get a diffferent prospective of what your future is going to look like. In classrooms there are intellectual debates and focus creates an active learning environment. Coming to LSSS was the right decision because you will have a lot of decisions what you will want to do in the future. For example, when I came to this school I was not comfortable talking to people, and now that I am graduating early I am focus and communicating with other students and teachers.', 'The teachers of the school are one of the things that stood out to me the most. The teachers actually care about the students. And I am not just talking about accepting late work, I am talking about pushing back due dates and taking time out of their day to help students with numerous problems. Furthermore, the teachers try their best to get to know the students in their classes. To learn about who the student is, what they like to do, and how they like to learn. Another thing that stood out to me from this school was the internship opportunities. Participating in an internship comes with many benefits. These benefits include but are not limited to: Experience in what your doing at the internship, having records of internships looks good on your resume, and stands out to colleges. In conclusion LSSS is a phenomenal school and I don’t regret coming here.', 'Ls3 is a school where you will find a variety of cultures. The school consists of friendly faces that are pretty welcoming for high school students. You will make friends with very interesting students from all walks of life. The school is not extremely small, but small enough where you feel like everyone is an annoying sibling you love to death. Teachers! Administration! Counselors! make Ls3 very unique. You will not find a more caring staff that is devoted to educating and bettering the future of their students. Most teachers are caring, passionate, and approach teaching with many different styles. Classrooms always feel like an open space. Our staff even comes on Saturdays for tutoring to give extra help. Lastly, what makes LSSS so unique are the academic opportunities that are offered. We have pre-college classes with Hunter College, partnerships with Mt. Sinai, courses at the AMNH, musical summer programs such as NYSSA, All City Choir Chorus, and annual trips to Hamilton!', 'Really great experience! Small school, and very helpful teachers .

It’s a small school but almost everyone gets along and I like it. What I would change about life sciences secondary school is that I think we should do more activities, have more clubs, and have more languages classes.', 'I love the forensics and art classes and teachers. Also my guidance counselor because she makes sure I am on track and she helps me to strive better and be great. She lets me know that I can be anything I want to be and I am a hard worker. I would like to see more cleaner hallways and bathrooms and better food.', 'Life sciences was a rollercoaster experience for me . It was a rollercoaster because I had my good and bad days since freshmen year. Freshmen year the school was crazy and a lot of students were doing bad but as I progressed on moving the 10 , 11 and 12 the grade the school and students got way much better. We got a different principle that enforced the rules and made sure everyone was in class and ready to succeed. Over all it was pretty good because I learned a lot of lessons and things from life science.', 'This school was not very good my freshman year, but it is so much better now that I am a senior. We got a new principal my sophomore year and she listens to students. She lets us go on trips now and we have more clubs. The old principal didn’t let us do anything. There used to be fight in the school everyday and now there are almost none because kids know they will be in trouble. My senior counselor is the best. She has done a lot to help me get into college. Every senior who graduates from Life Sciences gets a full scholarship to Monroe College. This is so good for me. I am really lucky for Ms. Swanson, Ms. Zaharakis, and the teachers here who push me to do my best. No school is perfect, but I am really happy at Life Sciences.', ""by far the worst high school i've ever attended, i can begin by stating the counselors assigned to you throughout the year were not helpful at all, they just tell you to do good and get you out of their sight as quickly as possible. Sometimes they get annoyed when you ask too much, sometimes they don't want to see any students at the moment. i can relate to other students as well, there is this one counselor called Diana Cantres, by far the worst counselor ever, never helped me achieve better, she never offered advice, help or opportunities to help better my studies.  i graduated back in 2016.  it has gotten worse over the years ad i am glad i left that school when i did."", ""My experience in Life Sciences Secondary School has been very diverse. I entered in my sophomore year and at first it felt welcoming and safe but as time passed it wasn't like that. The building I general is kept clean but the bathrooms are and issue. Some teachers did motivate me to keep trying as hard as I could during these past 2 years. However some teachers are very non caring and just hand out work based on videos. Personally I've had times when I haven't felt safe in school because of fights that have  occurred. However most of the times I do safe. The school has a friendly staff and friendly security who worry about your safety. Academic wise some teachers do challenge you and some teachers don't. Overall I have achieved many great things in the school due to my teachers and especially my guidance counselor who motivates me and other students to try our best and give more than what is expected from us."", ""Our principal did not throw away all of the books. I have them in all my classes. There are a lot of good teachers in Life Science but there are bad ones too. They are mean to kids and kick them out of class. The principal won't let them.

It still felt like there was still a lot of hand holding from the teachers. At times it felt like we were still in middle school while they were still trying to prepare us for college.

High School for Youth & Community Development,"['i like the fact that in ycd everybody is equal. You get same attention from everybody even if you are a student of color. one thing i would like to change about ycd is they should have lockers in the hallways.', 'I know everyone has their own opinions. However, I’ve been a student for 3 years and I can tell I had a great time.', 'My overall experience at YCD is good the school is driven to see their students succeed. During your time there administrators oftenly offer trips to various colleges and universities to allow for experience to be gained talking to colleges and getting you ready. The school grows year after year and more programs are being included.', 'I want to use the courtyard more often especially since it is springtime. There should be more available and outside lunches too with benches and the likes', ""I transferred to YCD junior year. This was one of the most important decisions I've ever made. I received top notch education from the finest teachers in New York City which led me to have a 3.3 GPA and a 1030 on my SATs. Also, I earned a scholarship to Western Connecticut State University. I was also a stand out athlete on the football team. We lost in the championship by 1 point. The students at YCD are so welcoming to incoming freshmen and we all love each other like a family. That's what separates YCD from other schools. We are a family."", 'When I first got into the school I was lost because of the size but everyone was so nice to me that I always found my way. The administration is really friendly, the teachers motivate their students and each and everyone got each others back. I just love YCD.', ""This school is the best school you can attend in brooklyn. Go on trips for free and have honor roll ceremony at the end of every marking period. The administration really cares about their students. they do not play with their culture and have respect for it. Security is very tight in school and also we have healthy food and clean water. There's a college coach to help both juniors and seniors with their applications, scholarships and also financial aid process. School nurse is provided. If you need any financial help, you can go to the office or tell your teachers."", 'In the years I have spent here I would have to say its been an overall great experience. The staff tends to every student and their individual needs. New programs and opportunity are always on the rise. Some things I would like to see change is the lack of diversity. Brining students from all walks of the ponds better prepare the students for whats to come. Also  giving the students more areas where constructive work can be done, but overall a great experience I will not forget.', 'My experience in this school has been interesting in terms of the diverse personalities I encounter daily, the motivational staff, and the family like atmosphere of the school. What I like about this school is that the staff and administration are always pushing you to do your best because they want you to maximize your full potential. The one thing I would change about this school is the amount of science classes offered because some colleges require certain scores in high school science classes so that you can be selected for a science program in college. If that class is not available, then I will not have a fair chance of getting into the program I wanted.', 'I entered YCD as a junior. I was a transfer student from Pakistan. But my guidance counselors and principal made it possible for me to graduate on a right time. They worked hard so do I to make it possible.The thing I liked the most about my school is the staff and the way they help every student. Including the principal, the whole staff helps a student on personal basis too as well as on academic basis.The change I would like to see in the school would be mixing of more students like students from every race and every part of the world. This would help new comers to get familiar to the environment easily and on a way faster way.', 'I had an ok experience its better then I thought it would be.

You get same attention from everybody even if you are a student of color. one thing i would like to change about ycd is they should have lockers in the hallways.', 'I know everyone has their own opinions. However, I’ve been a student for 3 years and I can tell I had a great time.', 'My overall experience at YCD is good the school is driven to see their students succeed. During your time there administrators oftenly offer trips to various colleges and universities to allow for experience to be gained talking to colleges and getting you ready. The school grows year after year and more programs are being included.', 'I want to use the courtyard more often especially since it is springtime. There should be more available and outside lunches too with benches and the likes', ""I transferred to YCD junior year. This was one of the most important decisions I've ever made. I received top notch education from the finest teachers in New York City which led me to have a 3.3 GPA and a 1030 on my SATs. Also, I earned a scholarship to Western Connecticut State University. I was also a stand out athlete on the football team. We lost in the championship by 1 point. The students at YCD are so welcoming to incoming freshmen and we all love each other like a family. That's what separates YCD from other schools. We are a family."", 'When I first got into the school I was lost because of the size but everyone was so nice to me that I always found my way. The administration is really friendly, the teachers motivate their students and each and everyone got each others back. I just love YCD.', ""This school is the best school you can attend in brooklyn. Go on trips for free and have honor roll ceremony at the end of every marking period. The administration really cares about their students. they do not play with their culture and have respect for it. Security is very tight in school and also we have healthy food and clean water. There's a college coach to help both juniors and seniors with their applications, scholarships and also financial aid process. School nurse is provided. If you need any financial help, you can go to the office or tell your teachers."", 'In the years I have spent here I would have to say its been an overall great experience. The staff tends to every student and their individual needs. New programs and opportunity are always on the rise. Some things I would like to see change is the lack of diversity. Brining students from all walks of the ponds better prepare the students for whats to come. Also  giving the students more areas where constructive work can be done, but overall a great experience I will not forget.', 'My experience in this school has been interesting in terms of the diverse personalities I encounter daily, the motivational staff, and the family like atmosphere of the school. What I like about this school is that the staff and administration are always pushing you to do your best because they want you to maximize your full potential. The one thing I would change about this school is the amount of science classes offered because some colleges require certain scores in high school science classes so that you can be selected for a science program in college. If that class is not available, then I will not have a fair chance of getting into the program I wanted.', 'I entered YCD as a junior. I was a transfer student from Pakistan. But my guidance counselors and principal made it possible for me to graduate on a right time. They worked hard so do I to make it possible.The thing I liked the most about my school is the staff and the way they help every student. Including the principal, the whole staff helps a student on personal basis too as well as on academic basis.The change I would like to see in the school would be mixing of more students like students from every race and every part of the world. This would help new comers to get familiar to the environment easily and on a way faster way.', 'I had an ok experience its better then I thought it would be.

This school does NOT prepare you for college. The highest expectation in this school is community college (and if you\'re lucky the local state university that\'s a mile away). This school simply does not prepare you for the rigor of higher education. First of all, the grade inflation in this school is so common that students will fail state testing and struggle in their future college classes yet have a 3.4 GPA throughout all of high school. 90% of the teachers do not care about teaching, even honors and AP teachers. There are a few exceptions that include teachers who are retiring, so.... Teachers in this school do not get hired because of their qualifications, they get qualified because of connections. It is clearly shown when faculty members are related or they come from the same exact school district.

While this might not be considered the best school, HHS definitely has many opportunities if you work diligently; HHS has AP courses, the written driving test, Financial Literacy, Mandarin, and a Culinary Program, which is not offered in other schools. Also, the teachers definitely push the students extremely hard, and they challenge the students; while HHS might be small, there is a lot of love. Many students attend the basketball games and football games to show their support. Also, with the Tricky Tray, many students and staff were willing to attend and help out. However, one thing I dislike about HHS is the enforcement of uniforms. I understand wearing uniforms are important, but sometimes I feel like the uniforms are more important than learning.

This is clearly evident through the student-teacher ratio of 10:1, the plethora of after school activities available to students, and the willingness of faculty to go the extra mile for the students. Every teacher knows every students by name at Keansburg and vise versa. I never had to compete for the attention of my teacher, especially when I needed extra help with a topic or assignment.

They give easy work and the students refuse to do it just because someone is telling them what to do.

I've cheered all four years of high school.  My freshman year the football team made it to the second round of the State Playoffs.  Every year after that, they've went 1 and 9 for the season.  The support from the school and community still remained the same all four years.  Whether we lost by 1 point, or by 60 points, every Saturday game had alumni, parents, classmates and teachers in the stands.  The Athletic Program at Keansburg High School is more like a family to me."", ""My educators are the most dedicated and selfless people I know.  Personally, aside from my mom, I'd have to say that my teachers are my biggest supports.  They're always in my corner, cheering me on in everything that I do.  In the past four years of High School, I have endured many personal struggles, academic successes and failures, and because of the effortless attempts from my teachers, to connect with me on every level, I am able to pursue my goals and dreams.

The support from the school and community still remained the same all four years.

I was able to travel to Southern Africa this summer to build a school. By far amazing experience at validus.', 'Overall, I have had 4 wonderful years at Validus Preparatory Academy.

Whereas it's academic profile is not superb, being due to its transparent admission requirements which mean to accept students from any cultural and academic background, Validus Preparatory Academy prefers to engage and aid students of the community despite their background so they can achieve success, instead than to keep an excellent academic profile by placing admission requirements and bragging of falsely  uplifting the community while doing so in a selective manner which ultimately does not uplift the community, much like schools in the area."", ""This is a great high school.

Specifically my English teacher assigns his students rigorous assignments and motivates others to have a high order thinking mind that will allow us to read and write analytically. There are multiple other teachers that motivate students to learn.

Also a lot of programs such as BuildOn and Trek for knowledge which allows students to earn community service hours and allow students to go to countries with low resources and in poverty to build schools for children that don't have.

Whereas it's academic profile is not superb, being due to its transparent admission requirements which mean to accept students from any cultural and academic background, Validus Preparatory Academy prefers to engage and aid students of the community despite their background so they can achieve success, instead than to keep an excellent academic profile by placing admission requirements and bragging of falsely  uplifting the community while doing so in a selective manner which ultimately does not uplift the community, much like schools in the area."", ""This is a great high school.

Many of the teachers encourage the students to complete all important assignments in all classes and strive for a high grade. Specifically my English teacher assigns his students rigorous assignments and motivates others to have a high order thinking mind that will allow us to read and write analytically. There are multiple other teachers that motivate students to learn.

Also a lot of programs such as BuildOn and Trek for knowledge which allows students to earn community service hours and allow students to go to countries with low resources and in poverty to build schools for children that don't have.

New Brunswick High School,"['New Brunswick High School is overall a decent high school, but I would not recommend it to people. The school has staff and faculty who care about students to a certain extent, but not enough to motivate them. Teachers in particular have a tendency of giving up on students once they begin to slack off. Instead of asking the students if they need help, or if anything is wrong with them emotionally, the students are punished and reflect a poor academic performance. Other than school work, the clubs are frequently promoted and students feel compelled to join because of that.', ""I like how the school isn't that big and that I can navigate around the school easily. The teachers try their hardest to keep everyone on the same level so that no one is left wondering what they are learning. The school overall is good and I would recommend many students to come here."", 'I liked being a part of the community at the high school because of all the hard work the staff and students put into making a healthy environment. Also being a part of the fine visual performing arts is amazing because of all the opportunities I was given and also the different people that I was able to meet.', 'What I tend to enjoy about New Brunswick High School is the community that is well presented as NBHS, my alumni’s tend to show their passion into school and tend to show how much of being a student at New Brunswick High School means. Without the people there would be fewer opportunities. However the change that needs to be offered is for the school to offer Spanish AP classes to those students who are very intrigued into their education and seek to want to advance their learning but in their fluent language, so overall y it is a good school with great protection but furthermore it’s surely a place you can get along with the people and advance your learning.', 'I love how diverse New Brunswick High School is, you never feel like an outsider. I love how much the teachers care about you and push you to be your best self and help unlock your greatest potential. My experience there was a great one and I hope to visit in the near future!', 'Very diverse school with a lot of opportunities. A lot of classes offered to get students prepared for life and their future career.', 'My school mostly consists of culture and people from different ethnicities . I feel like I belong here and I can connect with the people around me. I don’t feel different from anyone, there are people from different race and color, in a way we can all relate to one another.  That’s one of the things I like the most about my school. In addition, every administration is very friendly and are always looking out for every student both mentally and academically,making sure everyone is ok at all times. We have many talented people in our school and I enjoy looking at the marvelous art hall that consists of different painting, sculptures, etc. Once in a while we have people act out plays and show off their talent in the auditorium room where everyone can go watch.

The faculty and staff are helpful now but previous administration weren't the best and are to blame for a lot of transcript mishaps.

We're also provided with a number of college classes to gain college credits. The downfall of my school would be it's curriculum.  I personally believe an extended day school should provide classes that encourages creativity and problem solving skills rather than the typical math, science, English, and history.

It was my first time traveling alone on public transportation to attend a school where I knew nobody. Soon i adjusted to the environment and reacted to this experience optimistic as possible i soon made friends and lost some. In this school i felt myself maturing. I learned that it was okay to have different ideas from others and i also learned to become independent and to not let anyone make decisions for me. I learned if i wanted to succed i needed to work hard, because nothing was going to be handed to me.

As any freshman entering high school it was one of the most nerve wrecking experiences of my life. The elementary school and middle school that i attented were both only a few blocks away from my home so i grew up going to school with a lot of the same people i was ajusted well to the environment and i felt comfortable in these schools. But high school changed everything i was going to a attend a school that was fourty minutes away from my home. It was my first time traveling alone on public transportation to attend a school where I knew nobody. Soon i adjusted to the environment and reacted to this experience optimistic as possible i soon made friends and lost some. In this school i felt myself maturing. I learned that it was okay to have different ideas from others and i also learned to become independent and to not let anyone make decisions for me. I learned if i wanted to succed i needed to work hard, because nothing was going to be handed to me. This school was good because the teachers put the students to work hard and gave everyone a wake up call that they needed to work hard . This school also had negatives, because it tempted you to do what you weren't supposed to and follow the wrong crowd. This school was cery unique because it got rid of stereotypes, because of the not very pleasant neighborhood many people would assume that everybody in my school would be trouble makers and drop outs, but in fact this school carries very intelligent students i was astonished at all the new things i was learning from my fellow classmates i was introduced to new music new foods and got more insight on their cultures. Also this school was unique because all teachers had close relationships with their students and they tried very hard to get everyone on track, students were always eager to help our teachers when help was needed and every one had inside jokes."", ""i thought it was pretty fine for me because i make the best of it, i focus only on school assignments and never mingle with anyone i don't know in the school or want to know them either.

It would be very hard to bring a weapon into school because of the metal detectors. Our school is very strict about conflicts and very likely to assign suspensions. You would get suspended for 3 or 5 days just for being in an argument. You would also get suspended for attempting to stop or break up a fight. Bullying in the school definitely isn't allowed,  based on the bullying you see on television isn't something i've seen often in the school. Just females and males having issues and always trying to solve it in a hostile manner, whether it be verbally or physically. If you were in an argument, a dean would try to mediate the problem in a different room to decide on which action to take next."", ""The school could be cleaner in certain areas. It's rare to find soap and napkins in the bathrooms. The technology in our school is regular, however they did get new Smartboards. They do offer tutoring after school.

So To Build Strong relationships with them is key. Bushwick Leaders Has Some Flaws But None, That Can Overcome How Great The School and Staff members in them are.

My high school was not big enough and it did not get enough funding for even a little golf team. The weight room was in the back of the gym and it would get messed up.

The teachers and staff are welcoming and very caring. Over time I've built very strong relationships with my teachers and I felt like it should always be like that because students look up to them and look for them when in need. So To Build Strong relationships with them is key. Bushwick Leaders Has Some Flaws But None, That Can Overcome How Great The School and Staff members in them are. They take you in as their own and Help is Always giving 24/7. What I Love About Bushwick Leaders Is How their Main Goal Is To Get you prepared and Ready For College from the first step to when you walk Out ."", 'The extracurricular activities are very fun and exciting.

They mentally challenge us, so we can better ourselves. The teachers constantly make students engage in reading and critical thinking discussions. The teachers encourage us to do better.', 'it is a great school overall. there is a lot of support with college & life. there are no sports teams but the afterschool activities makeup for it', ""I enjoyed the experience simply because of some of the teachers I met and the close knit friends I made but if I could take those people with me to a different school and do it all over again I would.

The school did not have no sports team, no healthy food, some of the teachers were rude and inconsistent. I still visit the school but simply because of the 4 teachers that were the absolute best but once they leave I will not longer be visiting that school cause it just isn't a good place to spend 4 years at. You better off going somewhere else because this school doesn't have much to offer."", ""The food was never that good. Sometimes students would rather go a whole day without eating because the food was that bad. They never have a variety of food it was either you eat what they served or you don't eat at all and if you did not make it to the cafeteria within the first 15 minutes then you would miss out on eating because lunch time is only 25 minutes and if you was not done within the 25 minutes you had to throw your food away."", ""The staff is really concerned about the safety of the students in the school but because the students don't fear nor have respect for the staff they would do as they please and In result the school would have a lot of fights and once a kid ended up in the hospital due to a Snapple bottle being bashed against his head. We did have a dress code but it was not always followed and sometimes the staff would not even allow the students in the school because they did not have the dress code and sometimes because they came late to school so they were not allowed inside the building."", ""My school did not no sport teams at all. My high school was not big enough and it did not get enough funding for even a little golf team. The weight room was in the back of the gym and it would get messed up.
