Monmouth Regional High School,"['It was okay, could’ve been much better but you play the cards you’re dealt with.

What I did not like was how Monmouth ran some of their classes. Each year I felt like about half of my classes was me teaching myself the information because the teacher had failed to teach it correctly or failed to help me when I was completely lost. They packed everything into our lunch time thus instead of eating I would have to cram in time for studying and learning or going to clubs. Monmouth's clubs were amazing. They did many fundraisers for people in need and for themselves and were always successful. The Sports teams do not have the coaches with the most knowledge but my teammates along with myself could always find  way to make the best of it even when we have never had a winning season. Monmouth may have been the best years and I have had some good times, but I cannot wait to graduate and move on to a higher level of education and a new style of learning."", ""I think the teachers there care a lot about the kids.

Boonton High School,"['Through out my four years of attending boonton high school I would could consider it as a special place. When you walk threw the hallways there so much diversity and culture.The students for the most part are friendly and work hard. But this though my perspective. Others say that boonton is a bad place but it’s what you make out of it. Every school has slackers and people that don’t care about their grades. If you associate with them than it’s your fault. Either way if you experience these people in high school or not your going to deal with them at some point. One must know themselves and try to stick to our path and associate yourself with people that have goals. I’ve been able to do that my four years at Boonton high school. I have friends that support me and have the same goals. I’m so grateful for them and my mentors. The high also has some great teachers that have taught me many life lessons. Overall I would recommend this school.', 'The teachers are very friendly and offer a well-rounded education. You feel almost at home in this school.', 'Boonton High School gives you an experience very different than other schools. It has the average sports teams and standard lunch food, but its academics really cater to many types of students depending on the class. There are various opportunities to gain college credit and immerse yourself in unique electives such as Music Theory. There is something for everyone here.', 'The school needs better administration. Hopefully with more rules and enforcement, the students will understand what is expected of them. The school culture is that the school inst very serious and kind of a bad school. Better teachers and program opportunities would help out the school culture.', 'I liked all of the events at Boonton High School and how they engaged students and inspired school spirit. They provide students with many tools, resources, and opportunities to become a better student, athlete, leader, and person. The school also takes steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of their students.  This school has helped me to grow academically, take challenging classes, become a better speaker and leader, and make me proud to be a part of this school program.', 'The teachers at Boonton High school are very helpful and compassionate towards their students. The staff is very friendly. But the secretaries are rude when it comes to dealing with visitors and srudents.', 'I would like to see a cleaner school for both the students and teachers. School spirit should be increased because there is not much else to look forward to.', ""Boonton is a great place to find a welcoming group of students. It's not very hard to make friends and since it's a small school, it's very easy to get to know everyone. Although it's not that great academically, it definitely has potential, and from the three years I've been here I know that they're trying hard to make a positive change in the school's environment. Hopefully Boonton High School will become even better in the future."", 'I was apart of the Gateway Academy in its beginning years. The concept of the program was great, the execution was not. There was a separation of students in the program from other students that can be paralleled to special education. I could go on about the negative influences of ability grouping, but I will just say that it was isolating and lonely. I will also say that the additional assignments that came with being apart of the program were more annoying than productive. I left the program to find that the general education at this school was also poor. The teachers do not care and as result neither do the students. The administration is poor and changing constantly with little to no improvement. The only positive aspect of my experience at Boonton High School was the extracurricular activities I was apart of. GSA (Group Sports Association) and Track and Field were my highlights.', 'It’s a great school for a community feel. The people are great but the school lacks motivation in teachers and students. Students are not being challenged enough to really show their potential. Classes are a bit short too adequately to get a lesson across. Overall average school.', 'I have enjoyed my experience at Boonton High School these past couple years due to the welcoming atmosphere of the staff and my great group of friends. Usually, kids dread waking up for school, but for me, I know that the day will go smoothly and I have a little less of a struggle getting out of bed.', 'The atmosphere is very safe and supportive. The teachers are always there for extra help and prepare you for college, with challenging topics. Boonton High School is very diverse and with the class sizes being small, everyone knows each other.', 'Boonton high school is the school that teaches how to live your life in school, in college, and even after it. Boonton High School makes you feel like, you have a second home, everyone is like a family.', 'Just like any other school, or place you go, it is all about what you make of it. I truly enjoyed my time and experience at Boonton and I would not change a thing!', ""Boonton High school has come a long way from where it was 6 or 7 years ago but, I still would not say it's a top tier school.  It is a small group 1 with roughly 600 students in and in a small school like that I feel that sometimes they are behind in some newer technology and having nicer facilities.  Overall it's not a bad school but, sometimes it looks that way when you compare it to many of the other wealthy high schools in Morris County, NJ."", ""As far as high school goes, this one isn't as bad as some schools. The food is decent at best but served by lovely people. The staff at Boonton is always working towards making the school better. There are meetings at least once a week for faculty discussing any important events and projects to improve the climate and overall environment. Every single teacher goes the extra mile to help their students pass and shows students that they genuinely care. All of the teachers put up with a lot just to give all of us the best education they can. One thing I would change is the organization. With a new principal this seems to be an area of improvement, but prior to hiring him we could barely keep up with current events and such because the organization was so poor. Teachers were never told important things ahead of time and now that is changing."", 'Although BHS is not the best academically, I think they do great considering the resources they are provided. They give every student a tablet, have smart boards in every classroom, and most of the teachers are helpful and willing to spend extra time to give extra help.', ""My decision to attend Boonton High School has had such a monumental impact on me.  I am enrolled in the Gateway Academy, a program that promotes leadership and education inside and outside of the class room.  In this program, I was allowed to challenge myself in AP and honors classes since my freshman year of high school, which has helped me not only expand my mind, but to also be more prepared for college.  Boonton High School is a very diverse school, which has made me into a more cultured individual.  I have to say that I love everything about it, but it could use some slight improvements in it's cafeteria and facilities.  There should be a better variety of food in the cafeteria but that is my only complaint about it.  The facilities are often messy and equipment (stall dividers, sinks, etc.)  should be more durable because there has been times where they have broken.  Other than that, Boonton High School is a great place where learning thrives."", 'I love the opportunities given to students to expand their comfort zones.

When you walk threw the hallways there so much diversity and culture.The students for the most part are friendly and work hard. But this though my perspective. Others say that boonton is a bad place but it’s what you make out of it. Every school has slackers and people that don’t care about their grades. If you associate with them than it’s your fault. Either way if you experience these people in high school or not your going to deal with them at some point. One must know themselves and try to stick to our path and associate yourself with people that have goals. I’ve been able to do that my four years at Boonton high school. I have friends that support me and have the same goals. I’m so grateful for them and my mentors. The high also has some great teachers that have taught me many life lessons. Overall I would recommend this school.', 'The teachers are very friendly and offer a well-rounded education. You feel almost at home in this school.', 'Boonton High School gives you an experience very different than other schools. It has the average sports teams and standard lunch food, but its academics really cater to many types of students depending on the class. There are various opportunities to gain college credit and immerse yourself in unique electives such as Music Theory. There is something for everyone here.', 'The school needs better administration. Hopefully with more rules and enforcement, the students will understand what is expected of them. The school culture is that the school inst very serious and kind of a bad school. Better teachers and program opportunities would help out the school culture.', 'I liked all of the events at Boonton High School and how they engaged students and inspired school spirit. They provide students with many tools, resources, and opportunities to become a better student, athlete, leader, and person. The school also takes steps to ensure the safety and wellbeing of their students.  This school has helped me to grow academically, take challenging classes, become a better speaker and leader, and make me proud to be a part of this school program.', 'The teachers at Boonton High school are very helpful and compassionate towards their students. The staff is very friendly. But the secretaries are rude when it comes to dealing with visitors and srudents.', 'I would like to see a cleaner school for both the students and teachers. School spirit should be increased because there is not much else to look forward to.', ""Boonton is a great place to find a welcoming group of students. It's not very hard to make friends and since it's a small school, it's very easy to get to know everyone. Although it's not that great academically, it definitely has potential, and from the three years I've been here I know that they're trying hard to make a positive change in the school's environment. Hopefully Boonton High School will become even better in the future."", 'I was apart of the Gateway Academy in its beginning years. The concept of the program was great, the execution was not. There was a separation of students in the program from other students that can be paralleled to special education. I could go on about the negative influences of ability grouping, but I will just say that it was isolating and lonely. I will also say that the additional assignments that came with being apart of the program were more annoying than productive. I left the program to find that the general education at this school was also poor. The teachers do not care and as result neither do the students. The administration is poor and changing constantly with little to no improvement. The only positive aspect of my experience at Boonton High School was the extracurricular activities I was apart of. GSA (Group Sports Association) and Track and Field were my highlights.', 'It’s a great school for a community feel. The people are great but the school lacks motivation in teachers and students. Students are not being challenged enough to really show their potential. Classes are a bit short too adequately to get a lesson across. Overall average school.', 'I have enjoyed my experience at Boonton High School these past couple years due to the welcoming atmosphere of the staff and my great group of friends. Usually, kids dread waking up for school, but for me, I know that the day will go smoothly and I have a little less of a struggle getting out of bed.', 'The atmosphere is very safe and supportive. The teachers are always there for extra help and prepare you for college, with challenging topics. Boonton High School is very diverse and with the class sizes being small, everyone knows each other.', 'Boonton high school is the school that teaches how to live your life in school, in college, and even after it. Boonton High School makes you feel like, you have a second home, everyone is like a family.', 'Just like any other school, or place you go, it is all about what you make of it. I truly enjoyed my time and experience at Boonton and I would not change a thing!', ""Boonton High school has come a long way from where it was 6 or 7 years ago but, I still would not say it's a top tier school.  It is a small group 1 with roughly 600 students in and in a small school like that I feel that sometimes they are behind in some newer technology and having nicer facilities.  Overall it's not a bad school but, sometimes it looks that way when you compare it to many of the other wealthy high schools in Morris County, NJ."", ""As far as high school goes, this one isn't as bad as some schools. The food is decent at best but served by lovely people. The staff at Boonton is always working towards making the school better. There are meetings at least once a week for faculty discussing any important events and projects to improve the climate and overall environment. Every single teacher goes the extra mile to help their students pass and shows students that they genuinely care. All of the teachers put up with a lot just to give all of us the best education they can. One thing I would change is the organization. With a new principal this seems to be an area of improvement, but prior to hiring him we could barely keep up with current events and such because the organization was so poor. Teachers were never told important things ahead of time and now that is changing."", 'Although BHS is not the best academically, I think they do great considering the resources they are provided. They give every student a tablet, have smart boards in every classroom, and most of the teachers are helpful and willing to spend extra time to give extra help.', ""My decision to attend Boonton High School has had such a monumental impact on me.  I am enrolled in the Gateway Academy, a program that promotes leadership and education inside and outside of the class room.  In this program, I was allowed to challenge myself in AP and honors classes since my freshman year of high school, which has helped me not only expand my mind, but to also be more prepared for college.  Boonton High School is a very diverse school, which has made me into a more cultured individual.  I have to say that I love everything about it, but it could use some slight improvements in it's cafeteria and facilities.  There should be a better variety of food in the cafeteria but that is my only complaint about it.  The facilities are often messy and equipment (stall dividers, sinks, etc.)  should be more durable because there has been times where they have broken.  Other than that, Boonton High School is a great place where learning thrives."", 'I love the opportunities given to students to expand their comfort zones. The Gateway Academy is a great resource for qualified students.', 'School is outdated but currently its undergoing renovations to improve the school. New administration memebers and a new principal are helping to change the school into something better. School is kind of dirty and can be cleaned up more.

Just focus and my best advice would be not to procrastinate and sometimes its good to have a small circle.', ""To be honest the school is great overall.

She cares about her students and always makes time to speak to anyone when they are upset. She helps push you and encourages you to get involved. The teachers are nice and care for students.

High School for Environmental Studies,"['Overall, High School for Environmental Studies was an excellent school. It was a small school so everyone knew each other which I loved. I wanted to be in a school where each teacher knew me personally and that is exactly what I received in this school. The staff and faculty were amazing. They cared for all the students and made sure everyone was on the right path and if we ever needed something, they made sure they had an answer for us.', 'Joining high school for environmental studies was not a terrible choice for me. Of course there was the students which a lot of them seemed like they did not put a lot of effort ,but the administration tried their best to motivate them to learn and graduate.  Some of the students there are extremely motivated and well-behaved and, I am able to make flourishing relationship with them. The teachers I had while there showed that they cared for their students ,and the subject they were learning. Most of the teachers tried to connect to the students ,and make them encouraged to learn. The resources given to us is a little crummy as well as the amount of arts in the place; however , this is counteracted by the fact that the academics are quite good and all the sports clubs we have. So I have enjoyed my High school so far.', 'My experience at Environmental Studies was not bad, nor great.  We have a very good diversity of students and faculty.  While we have a diverse mix of students with different academic and intellectual abilities, the problem that we have at High School for Environmental studies, is that they mix all the students into their classes, without offering honors classes for most of the science courses.  This makes it challenging for our teachers, because they have to go at a pace that will not drown our weaker student.  Some of the students in our classes are so weak in their academic backgrounds that they struggle in these classes.  It forces our teachers to water down the rigor of the course material to the point that our intellectually gifted classmates are not being given the proper course rigor, to further challenge and develop their intellectual abilities.  This is the main problem with our school.  The rest is okay.', 'There is a culture where sports students get away with what they do. Also, just like every school there are fights that happen. School administration is actually starting to change, and I believe that there would be a change soon.', 'I love the community in this school between students, teachers, and staff. As soon as you walk into this school you are bound to always find someone you can talk to or someone you can ask for help. Although this school is some what small, you will always see a familiar face and know the classmates you’ll be spending a few years with. Something I would like to change or improve in this school would be the courses and the variety. However, I’m very glad to see that this upcoming year there has been some new classes added like AP Psychology and AP Chemistry, this means the school is slowly but surely integrating new courses that would actually interest their students.', 'This school has provided a rich experience in diversity and culture for me. There were many different activities and clubs to participate in which where made for students to feel included in the schools community. I believe the academics really helped prepared me for my future career and for attending university.', ""This school has many opportunities like scholarships and teachers are attentive and help their students to prepare for college. There is rarely any fights and the teachers don't ignore people"", 'This school is nice. I would love to see changes in academic work in a few clubs. This school has a great community and is not judgmental at all. I do not regret going to this school.', ""The teachers make a very visible effort to teach and encourage the kids. We are also provided a wide variety of clubs, but I feel like the school could provide more for them. Many of our classes aren't environmentally focused like our school claims to be. There are also many misbehaving students at my school. However, I have and continue to enjoy my experience at the High School for Environmental Studies and it's easy to see that my school is taking strides forward."", ""My experience at HSES was overall pretty good. I don't have any complaints about the core curriculum. Although some teachers at this school were careless about the class they were teaching, I really feel like the good teachers outweighed the bad. The majority of the students were not goal oriented and made it difficult for this school to be a safe environment. I would like to see a change in HSES's college advisory department and guidance counselor department. I find it impossible and simply unjust at the fact that there is only one guidance counselor per grade this would mean that each counselor was assigned 400 students. This was just outrageous and made it extremely difficult for students to receive proper and individual care. The college advisory office only had 1 counselor for the entire senior class! There was a lot of negligence when it came to students and their college application process. I would like to see some improvement in this."", ""Good school if you know how to take advantage of the programs. High School for Environmental Studies is improving very well. Filled with students who want to improve and like all schools it has some students who don't"", 'I graduated from High School For Environmental studies and as the years went by more sports activity clubs were put in. Such as cooking class , yoga. Its all about making the students do something different for them to enjoy.', ""I had a great time there. there's a lot of things you can do to get involved and although when i first started at the school it was super bad, I've seen in morph into a great place for all students ( sporty, challenged, hardworking, sciencey, environmental, etc). what i would like to see happen is a better distribution of the funding or simply acquiring more funding because there are certain aspects of a students experience that would greatly improve if we had more, for instance, gym equipment, however, it's not the school's fault per-say. The High School for Environmental Studies is overall a good place for your child to go to."", 'I have been going to this highschool since sophmore year and it has been a good experience. There is a lot of hands on activities such as clubs and sports. Since its a environmental achool there is alot of recycling  and reusing of materials. Overall this high school has been a good experience so far and i would recommend it.', 'It’s ok I guess I mean some rooms have no windows but we have some decent students. I wouldn’t say it’s a terrible school.', 'I think High School of Environmental Studies (or HSES as we students call it) is a school truly built on community and educational pride. At least that is true of those like myself who are in the honors program. I am especially fond of the English teachers, although the other teachers in core and extracurricular subjects do superb jobs as well. But the English teachers really seem to take their job of not only teacher but also as mentors, advisors and supporters seriously and execute that with such professionalism and friendliness.', ""My experience in HSES is good because I get academic help if needed, the teachers are dedicated to their work and to making sure students are on the right tracks, I'm always being challenged in class to do better, and they help with preparation for college."", ""The people you choose to surround yourself with at this school does effect your high school experience. They tell you that the honors program doesn't matter, the kids who begin in honors classes freshman year are usually the ones offered AP classes in the long run.  If you're looking for a school with an inclusive community, you won't find that here. We have had the same college counselor for god knows how long and that lady needs to be coached on how to actually give students useful information about applying to college. And because it is the same person who has to write over 200 hundred recommendations for the senior class all on her own, they all come out mediocre. The worst part of this school is the system itself, it almost feels like your words are not heard at this school and despite student councilor efforts they never seem to be in favor of the students here."", ""What I loved about HSES was the relationship that the students made with the faculty and staff. What I would like to see change is the types of colleges that we are made aware of. Although black students did not make up the majority, it would have been nice to be made aware of HBCU's."", 'I like how the teachers involve the parents and are always there to assist you.

However, I’m very glad to see that this upcoming year there has been some new classes added like AP Psychology and AP Chemistry, this means the school is slowly but surely integrating new courses that would actually interest their students.', 'This school has provided a rich experience in diversity and culture for me. There were many different activities and clubs to participate in which where made for students to feel included in the schools community. I believe the academics really helped prepared me for my future career and for attending university.', ""This school has many opportunities like scholarships and teachers are attentive and help their students to prepare for college. There is rarely any fights and the teachers don't ignore people"", 'This school is nice. I would love to see changes in academic work in a few clubs. This school has a great community and is not judgmental at all. I do not regret going to this school.', ""The teachers make a very visible effort to teach and encourage the kids. We are also provided a wide variety of clubs, but I feel like the school could provide more for them. Many of our classes aren't environmentally focused like our school claims to be. There are also many misbehaving students at my school. However, I have and continue to enjoy my experience at the High School for Environmental Studies and it's easy to see that my school is taking strides forward."", ""My experience at HSES was overall pretty good. I don't have any complaints about the core curriculum. Although some teachers at this school were careless about the class they were teaching, I really feel like the good teachers outweighed the bad. The majority of the students were not goal oriented and made it difficult for this school to be a safe environment. I would like to see a change in HSES's college advisory department and guidance counselor department. I find it impossible and simply unjust at the fact that there is only one guidance counselor per grade this would mean that each counselor was assigned 400 students. This was just outrageous and made it extremely difficult for students to receive proper and individual care. The college advisory office only had 1 counselor for the entire senior class! There was a lot of negligence when it came to students and their college application process. I would like to see some improvement in this."", ""Good school if you know how to take advantage of the programs. High School for Environmental Studies is improving very well. Filled with students who want to improve and like all schools it has some students who don't"", 'I graduated from High School For Environmental studies and as the years went by more sports activity clubs were put in. Such as cooking class , yoga. Its all about making the students do something different for them to enjoy.', ""I had a great time there. there's a lot of things you can do to get involved and although when i first started at the school it was super bad, I've seen in morph into a great place for all students ( sporty, challenged, hardworking, sciencey, environmental, etc). what i would like to see happen is a better distribution of the funding or simply acquiring more funding because there are certain aspects of a students experience that would greatly improve if we had more, for instance, gym equipment, however, it's not the school's fault per-say. The High School for Environmental Studies is overall a good place for your child to go to."", 'I have been going to this highschool since sophmore year and it has been a good experience. There is a lot of hands on activities such as clubs and sports. Since its a environmental achool there is alot of recycling  and reusing of materials. Overall this high school has been a good experience so far and i would recommend it.', 'It’s ok I guess I mean some rooms have no windows but we have some decent students. I wouldn’t say it’s a terrible school.', 'I think High School of Environmental Studies (or HSES as we students call it) is a school truly built on community and educational pride. At least that is true of those like myself who are in the honors program. I am especially fond of the English teachers, although the other teachers in core and extracurricular subjects do superb jobs as well. But the English teachers really seem to take their job of not only teacher but also as mentors, advisors and supporters seriously and execute that with such professionalism and friendliness.', ""My experience in HSES is good because I get academic help if needed, the teachers are dedicated to their work and to making sure students are on the right tracks, I'm always being challenged in class to do better, and they help with preparation for college."", ""The people you choose to surround yourself with at this school does effect your high school experience. They tell you that the honors program doesn't matter, the kids who begin in honors classes freshman year are usually the ones offered AP classes in the long run.  If you're looking for a school with an inclusive community, you won't find that here. We have had the same college counselor for god knows how long and that lady needs to be coached on how to actually give students useful information about applying to college. And because it is the same person who has to write over 200 hundred recommendations for the senior class all on her own, they all come out mediocre. The worst part of this school is the system itself, it almost feels like your words are not heard at this school and despite student councilor efforts they never seem to be in favor of the students here."", ""What I loved about HSES was the relationship that the students made with the faculty and staff. What I would like to see change is the types of colleges that we are made aware of. Although black students did not make up the majority, it would have been nice to be made aware of HBCU's."", 'I like how the teachers involve the parents and are always there to assist you. I would change the safety. I feel like there could be more police presence outside of the school']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""My high school soccer was really good. we were division champions in 2017. also, my school offers varieties of college courses, like AP and ESF college courses. what don't like about it is that it is very small and hall ways get pack and causes delays."", 'I loved the teacher at h.s.e.s they are every kind and are good teachers overall.

The sports team such as volleyball and football was always exciting to watch with the school spirit Woodbridge High School has. I believe the academics can be improved by pushing senior students to take college credit courses. It is imperative to exceed what it means to teach students how to be successful along with resources. As much as Woodbridge High School emphasized how important it is to go to college , resources was something I had to do outside of school.

For example, every year during the months of October and November they collect non perishable items to make over 55 full Thanksgiving baskets for families in the Woodbridge community and even for families right here in our school that don't have certain opportunities like others.

There's not much that I would change about Woodbridge High School, as it's a very good school already."", 'The teachers are for higher level courses ( honors, Ap) are amazing. They teach very well, always offer extra help, and are very considerate towards their students. Sports and school spirit are also very good as we have 3 pep rally’s throughout the year and have several brand new turf fields on campus. There are many clubs ranging from Christian club to ASL club.  I would like to see some new course offerings, and more dual enrollment programs.', ""With my experience at Woodbridge High School I have learned so much about myself. I realized how determined I was for my future and it pushed me to make choices to better my future. Throughout all the struggles I've been through the high school always adapted to what I faced and I had a great support system of teachers and peers. I wouldn't want to end my high school career anywhere else."", 'It was a good experience the educational structure has been revised and improved each year which overall became helpful to my learning.', 'Staff is excellent, very effective while also being friendly and personable. Guidance is very helpful. Offers many different classes and college level courses. Many clubs and sports available as well.', ""As a senior this year at Woodbridge High School, I have absolutely loved my time spend these 4 years.I have been very blessed and treated with the up most  love and respect by my teachers and fellow students. If I wasn't for my teachers believing in me I wouldn't be the academic scholar that I am today. I am extremely thankful for all the times they have gone out of their way to help me understand a certain topic in a specific class. Also being a soccer player for my high school there wasn't one time where either Mr. Lottmann, Mrs Panko, or Mr. Perry weren't there supporting my teammates and I. I am forever grateful and thankful to Woodbridge High School for the best 4 years of my life."", ""Coming into WHS as a freshman, I was nervous and I didn't know what to expect. But the administration, teachers, and staff, as well as the friends that I made, made my experience at Woodbridge amazing. I just started my senior year, and the school spirit and pride that I have seen this year does not even compare to the past 3 years. I love the class of 2020 and I am so excited for all of the fun events this year!"", 'I enjoy going to Woodbridge High School. The teachers make sure that each student gets sufficient help in order for them to succeed. However, the Arts Programs are amazing but do not get enough attention. I would change that. Every AP class enables every kid to get a 5 on their exams. Overall, I would recommend WHS every time.', ""For the most part, I had a pleasant experience at Woodbridge. Other than the more than occasional cockroach, WHS is a great place to attend aslong as you get involved and don't make trouble for yourself."", 'I like the public school experience being that I came from a charter school. I wish we could get better prepared for college.', ""WHS isn't a terrible school. To me, the worst qualities of the school are the poor food and the bathrooms not being open during passing time. I really do enjoy the willingness of most teachers, except almost all of the gym teachers with the exception of a few, to help you achieve the highest possible grade. Another annoyance is the attendance officer. She's nasty to everyone and there are times that she doesnt excuse absences even with a note. Also beware of roaches."", 'Woodbridge high school keeps good relationships with their students. With a variety of clubs and sports offered to the students, it is hard to stay bored. The high school also offers many AP classes with great teachers that actually understand the material.', 'I like the diversity and how there was always a club or sports team having an event at school. I wish they would put more money into the art classes.', ""Woodbridge High School was an experience that shaped me into the person I wanted to be in order to succeed in college. Teachers and Administrators emphasized how important it is to apply for college and taking the SAT's. Diversity was a huge impact in the school , you get to learn about different cultures. The sports team such as volleyball and football was always exciting to watch with the school spirit Woodbridge High School has. I believe the academics can be improved by pushing senior students to take college credit courses. It is imperative to exceed what it means to teach students how to be successful along with resources. As much as Woodbridge High School emphasized how important it is to go to college , resources was something I had to do outside of school. Overall Woodbridge High School was an average experience."", 'The teachers were pretty great except for some. They help as much as they can with anything. It’s easy to build healthy relationships with all of the staff.', ""I love woodbridge high school. The administration is amazing and cares so much for the students. The teachers are always offering their help and extra time as well. You never feel like there is nobody for you to turn to and that there is nobody that is able to relate to you and help in any situation. There's nothing  I would change."", ""I loved how the teachers are caring and how willing they are to take time out of their day to either come early to school or stay after school with students to help them with classwork they may not understand. I also love the work and effort certain clubs like the interact club put in for the community. For example, every year during the months of October and November they collect non perishable items to make over 55 full Thanksgiving baskets for families in the Woodbridge community and even for families right here in our school that don't have certain opportunities like others. The only concern I have is the building itself needs to be renovated, but other then that the school is great."", 'Woodbridge High School was able to provide a good high school experience for me. I was involved in the many activities they had to offer such as Cheerleading, a Mentors Program, and the National Honor Society. I was also able to find many friends and form solid friendships over the four years. Despite the great experience, one thing I would like to see change is the scheduling of the classes. I would like to have time for homeroom in the mornings to help the students adjust to the educational setting.', 'My daughter graduated from Woodbridge High School in 2018.  She did very well in school and is currently in college.  The teachers and principal are wonderful and she belonged to many clubs .  Great school.', 'Best school in Woodbridge. Teacher and staff are excellent. We have enjoyed being a part of this school.

They're all very nice and friendly, but it seems like that gets in the way of them actually doing their job."", ""Compared to the schools around it Woodlands is a very small school, which many students like because you grow up and graduate with people you've known your entire life if you grew up in the district. Yet other students may dislike due to again, everyone knowing each other. Due to it being such a small school it is very easy to create strong bonds and good relationships with your guidance counselors and your teachers. They are always willing to help as long as you make sure to ask for the help. Students can easily start their own clubs, however the school lacks school spirit."", 'I\'am a Junior in  Woodlands and  this experience has been awful. There is a lot of fights and teachers are very rude. A lot of the teachers threaten kids and instead of helping them learn they make them feel worse about their selves.

The "" monitors"" speak to kids as if they\'re there age with lots of cursing, I have experienced a Spanish teachers talk about me and my peers in Spanish knowing we do not know the language and being called out by another by-racial student.

What I think sets Woodlands apart from other schools is the close connection you build with the teachers and guidance counselors. Both, the teachers and guidance counselors, work hard to make sure that each student is getting the help that they need. However, they won't give you that help if you don't learn to ask for it.

Many courses to choose from. College English classes are made available by SUNY Westchester Community College and you can receive up to 3 college credits. Many people are there to help you. Small school but they seem to focus on you more since they don't have to worry about a thousand kids. Having a small population lets there be some clarity on the who needs what or who did what. Not enough funds to have plenty of sports like spring soccer or lacrosse."", ""I transferred to Woodlands as a junior from Pleasantville High School. Because the school isn't very diverse, adjusting was difficult for me. Once I became familiar with the school and all the opportunities it has to offer, it was smooth sailing.

I will never be able to thank Woodlands enough for the opportunities I have received thus far and the friendships that I will cherish for a lifetime."", 'My high school is very diverse, we have many people from a lot of different cultural backgrounds that attend. Being that my high school is particularly smaller than other neighboring schools, we all know each other and are a close-knit community. Within our small environment, we have dozens of teachers that are committed to seeing all of their students succeed. Each marking period, the number of students on the honor roll sky rockets. At the end of every year, the staff is also very proud to see the increasing number of graduating students. What I like the most about my school is that we all push each other to do better and are always encouraging and open to helping other students.

I feel that if we have a bit more variety, more students would want to become more involved in bettering their high school experience.', ""The teachers are great, they are so caring for the students, they are involved in the students life, but the students don't seem to care about life after high school.

The only real issue I have with the school is perhaps the hall monitors. They're all very nice and friendly, but it seems like that gets in the way of them actually doing their job."", ""Compared to the schools around it Woodlands is a very small school, which many students like because you grow up and graduate with people you've known your entire life if you grew up in the district. Yet other students may dislike due to again, everyone knowing each other. Due to it being such a small school it is very easy to create strong bonds and good relationships with your guidance counselors and your teachers. They are always willing to help as long as you make sure to ask for the help. Students can easily start their own clubs, however the school lacks school spirit."", 'I\'am a Junior in  Woodlands and  this experience has been awful. There is a lot of fights and teachers are very rude. A lot of the teachers threaten kids and instead of helping them learn they make them feel worse about their selves. The school lunch is nasty and tends to be unhealthy at times, they serve awful pizza everyday and their meat can be over cooked or un cooked. The "" monitors"" speak to kids as if they\'re there age with lots of cursing, I have experienced a Spanish teachers talk about me and my peers in Spanish knowing we do not know the language and being called out by another by-racial student. I advise anyone and EVERYONE not to come to the school.', 'The school does a bad job at allocating our income, we have bought 4 televisions but somehow can still not fix the chipping paint or the holes in the wall, most teachers are not the best and we could do better, also the teachers/ monitors could improve their behavior towards students.

What I think sets Woodlands apart from other schools is the close connection you build with the teachers and guidance counselors. Both, the teachers and guidance counselors, work hard to make sure that each student is getting the help that they need. However, they won't give you that help if you don't learn to ask for it. There are many different cultures among the students which produces an diverse and inclusive learning environment for everyone."", 'Woodlands is a pretty good school and I feel does an excellent job of preparing its students for the future.

They’re very helpful and encourage us to reach our full potential. It isn’t a big school compared to others which is good because everyone knows of or knows each other. The food is not bad, they have an assortment of options. I have to admit they should have more vegetarian options for students/staff. Overall if I ever come back to Westchester I would definitely send my future kids there!', ""Classes are great but as in every school, there will always be those students that are not the best behaved. Many courses to choose from. College English classes are made available by SUNY Westchester Community College and you can receive up to 3 college credits. Many people are there to help you. Small school but they seem to focus on you more since they don't have to worry about a thousand kids. Having a small population lets there be some clarity on the who needs what or who did what. Not enough funds to have plenty of sports like spring soccer or lacrosse."", ""I transferred to Woodlands as a junior from Pleasantville High School. Because the school isn't very diverse, adjusting was difficult for me. Once I became familiar with the school and all the opportunities it has to offer, it was smooth sailing.

I will never be able to thank Woodlands enough for the opportunities I have received thus far and the friendships that I will cherish for a lifetime."", 'My high school is very diverse, we have many people from a lot of different cultural backgrounds that attend. Being that my high school is particularly smaller than other neighboring schools, we all know each other and are a close-knit community. Within our small environment, we have dozens of teachers that are committed to seeing all of their students succeed. Each marking period, the number of students on the honor roll sky rockets. At the end of every year, the staff is also very proud to see the increasing number of graduating students. What I like the most about my school is that we all push each other to do better and are always encouraging and open to helping other students. Something I would change however, would be the variety of opportunities. I feel that if we have a bit more variety, more students would want to become more involved in bettering their high school experience.', ""The teachers are great, they are so caring for the students, they are involved in the students life, but the students don't seem to care about life after high school.

Dwight Morrow High School/Academies at Englewood,"[""This school has potential, but it's ultimately wasted by the administration. The school has gone through so much administration and they still can't get it right. I feel like I'm constantly in danger due to the number of fights that happen at the school. The bathrooms cannot be used normally, the students do things in the bathroom that just don't make any sense. Most of the staff have no clue what they're doing, but there are some who are really great but are shadowed by the constant issues in the school. The diversity doesn't even matter because it has nothing to do the education. Overall, the school is pretty poor, only due to the administration, but it's not like the student body is any better."", ""I'm a senior at the Academies at Englewood, and the main problems that we've been having are with the administration. This year is the 3rd new principal our school has had since I came here. Everything  is disorganized and it seems that nobody knows what is going on. For example, in September they told us senior internships would start in October. It is now the end of October and they're saying they will start in either December or January. This school is a mess."", ""My experience at DMAE has been very good so far. As a junior currently, I can say that this school has helped me become a more accomplished student overall. The main source of my progression is a mix of friendly competition and personal motivation combined. Though, I would say that the school missed the 5-star mark because there are various inconveniences that occur due to disorganization. For example, I would be marked as a tardy truant despite having a doctor's note. Other than that, I would recommend the academy program to any student who is highly motivated to succeed academically and not fall under pressure."", ""Dwight Morrow has a very entertaining marching band as well as a good band instructor. The administration here doesn't care about the students and seeing them succeed. There are very few courses preparing students for college. There is a lot of violence here as well as most things being disorganized. The students barely care or put in effort because the faculty doesn't."", ""Dwight Morrow High School is not your average high school. Being that it is located in Englewood, NJ, you would have lots of thoughts on the school. It could either be bad or good, depending on which part of town you're familiar with. I grew up on the good side of Englewood so I only experienced the bad because of troubled students. The education varies, because there are some really good teachers and a lot of bad teachers. There is no school spirit what so ever and the sport teams are horrible. Dwight Morrow focuses and cares a lot for the football team and a bit of the boys soccer and no one else. Their music and arts field is okay. This is school is very diverse, ranging from students in and out of town. The food is terrible, but you can't really expect much from a high school I guess."", 'Dwight Morrow High School is such a strange experience. The fellow students in the school are second to none but the administration has been consistent in failing students and even teachers to meet reasonable expectation. There are many different possibilities available in the school but schedules are very restricting.', 'I believe the students are treated like children rather than young adults and discipline is necessary but can get too far', 'I like that Dwight Morrow is a very inclusive school that is very diverse. The campus is beautiful and spacious which gives students tons of mobility. Dwight Morrow presents its students with tons of resources and opportunities to express themselves creatively such as ""Englewood Idol"" and Diversity Day. What I dislike is how unorganized the school is ran and how things do not get done in a timely manner.', 'One thing I liked about Dwight morrow was that it was very diverse. There was no discrimination and there were people from all types of different countries. They had many clubs and activities for us to do and even had a “safe space” in which everyone is welcome. I also like that there were plenty of listening adults there so growing a bond with some teacher and weren’t a problem. Security even build bonds with the students and try to help the students stay out of trouble which a lot of school can’t relate to. I had a wonderful time at my high school for the most part and I’m glad I attended.', ""Studying here was a one of a kind start to pursuing my passion for the medical field. As prestigious as this sounds, I noticed soon that quality of education and administration began to diminish. The school had no control over students and some teachers weren't dedicated to making sure the material was understood. The school went through three different principals in 4 years. I never really got to know any of them. I took a math class my sophomore year in which we were doing all work through the internet. The teacher seemed to be there just to help here and there. Then, she disappeared for months. I fell behind in math drastically. Also, there are multiple problematic teachers, some of them racist, that cannot be fired as they are hard to replace. The school looks great from the outside, but needs reform on the inside."", ""Overall, the Englewood Academies is a wonderful high school with an enriching atmosphere, diverse student body, and groundbreaking curriculum. One of the best high school experiences in the world, this school offers an extraordinary variety of clubs, activities, courses, and opportunities for a successful future. The Academies bestow all of their students with the impeccable standards of excellence they possess, empowering them with the foundations needed for success in today's standards of life and living. Thriving in the Academies is both challenging but experiential, as it fosters a simulation of the workload, environment, and endeavor in college and beyond."", 'Great School. When I first got into this school I was really upset but as time went on I started participating in activities and had a lot of fun. Teachers are great.

What I would like to see change is the curriculum.', ""Dwight Morrow High School/ Academies@Englewood has great programs to offer. They allow students to take AP courses, honors, or dual enrollment classes. At the Academies the students take core classes but they have a focus of either bio-med, pre-engineering, law and public safety, or finance. I transferred to this school two years ago and it was very easy for me to adjust. One things the school can work on getting things done faster. You practically have to beg them to get something done. Also, some of the teachers I've had did not teach me and just gave the class busy work. Overall the school is okay for a public school."", 'I really enjoyed going to Dwight Morrow. It was very diverse in many areas, from the classrooms to the students. I met so many different ethnicities that I learned so much about them I. Such a short period of time.

Predatory alienation to kids to keep them from being protected by their parents.

Bergen County Judge recently ruled behavioral modification to kids and Dwight Morrow High School  with terrible psychotropic drugs and black box anti-depressants that can cause suicide and should never ever be given to children is not only a good practice but any parents complaining must be unstable and should lose their kids.

I never really got to know any of them. I took a math class my sophomore year in which we were doing all work through the internet. The teacher seemed to be there just to help here and there.

Student involvement is usually pretty decent. There always seems to be enough people pushing to join teams in the sense that teams can be formed - no lack of participants. Team performance is average. Between wins and losses, there have been a few trophies and medals. There is a consistent amount of fan support. In terms of school spirit: it is a passive topic for those that are not terribly involved. Athletic facilities: The school's small space is fully utilized.

Achievement First - Crown Heights School,"['I’ve been attending Achievement First since kindergarten. It’s honestly been quite a ride! Academically achievement first excels in preparing their students for middle school, high school, then onward to college. You’re child can receive all the help they need to be successful. However Achievement first tends to also prioritize things that may not be prioritized as we go onward as we go further with our education. For example behavior is heavily prioritized sometimes even over academics. Also achievement first tends to baby their students in a way that they won’t be babied in their future lives. Meaning that me being a student for 13 years now I have held my teachers hand for way too long forgetting that in life it will only be just me. There can be changes made to the AF system but overall they have pushed their scholars from day 1 to be the best scholars they can be.', 'This school has great academics and besides that we are known for our dance, music, art and especially sports skills as well. In this school, you know you will get accepted to a great college. I believe the merit and demerit system should change because that is the only thing that doesn’t prepare for college. Having that system doesn’t prepare us to be independent and make mistakes on our own time and learn from them. It just babies us.

With my academics achievements throughout the years, Achievement First Have help  shape my character. Achievement First is a tough school, but it pushes you beyond what you expect from yourself.

You’re child can receive all the help they need to be successful. However Achievement first tends to also prioritize things that may not be prioritized as we go onward as we go further with our education. For example behavior is heavily prioritized sometimes even over academics. Also achievement first tends to baby their students in a way that they won’t be babied in their future lives.

They all strive for the best. The teaching styles are encouraged to be the same, which is teaching until you understand the material. Teachers are forced to provide extra help to any students who do not completely understand the material after or before class. Although they are forced by school rules you can tell that the teachers want to be there. You can see the enjoyment of seeing students understanding the material after being taught over again. These extra help classes are usually in small groups or made by appointment which is great because it make students more focused and ready to learn. The grading policy at this school is very fair. On all assignments you either get a Not Yet, Meeting Standards, or Exceeding Standards. This method specifically tells you where you are. You can see which rating you get for each and every assignment you get."", ""I was apart of the second graduating class in my high school. Being that it was a new school there were not many funds available for extracurriculars. Although there was not much money available, the teaching staff knew the importance of extracurriculars for students. Clubs and sports help keep many students focused and also gives them some time to relax and have fun. At the Young Women's Leadership school many teachers volunteered to stay after or before school for extracurricular activities without or for pay. Some of these programs include the: debate team, math4you club, Muslim support group, LGBT community club, volleyball team, rugby team, basketball team, and many more. There is also always opportunity to form your own extracurricular activities at this amazing school."", 'I felt very prepared for what many of my previous teachers called ""the real world"" after graduating high school. Being that I had began attending the Young Women\'s Leadership School since 6th grade this transition into the real world began since then, six years ago. Since on the first day of school I was constantly told all the basics to surviving life after high school. On the first day of school there I had to sign a form that stated I would stay in the school from middle to high school no matter my circumstances. This taught me the value of commitment. It was a very ""grown-up"" thing to do at that age, a decision that would affect the next six years of my life. After high school I began an internship at an accounting office where I had to sign a contract that made me agree to the facilities rules and regulations for the next year. Most post-graduates would see this contract as something to think about, or a big commitment. For me I knew that I had commitments for the company since the day I applied for the internship and was completely ready to sign anything that would prove it. Commitment is a big part of the real world. You have to commit to work, school, and even time for family and friends. The Young Women\'s Leadership School of Astoria definitely prepared me for this ""real world"" I am currently living in and enjoying.', ""There is a uniform code at this school. The principal, assistant principal, teachers, office staff and counselors make sure to remind parents that the students should be following the code. The office staff call home whenever a student is out of uniform to inform the parents. Attendance is handled the same. If a student is late or absent the parents are given a call to be updated on their daughter's."", 'There is a variety of extracurricular activities from volleyball to multicultural club, and the drama club. The commitment to these activities is very strong. From the beginning there is a limit of the number of people in each club. The students enjoy working together and taking leadership positions such as President, or Treasurer of the Multicultural Club, or Captain of the basketball team. The club members make sure to engage students to attend their plays, games, and event.', 'This school has a supportive staff family.', 'There are no sports except running club.', 'The school is pretty safe, the students always have to be in the room with an adult supervising. But like other things like the school nurse, she is sometimes busy handling one student. Sometimes, you have to hope she is available.', 'The teachers have office hours where students can go and ask any questions or problems they are dealing with in their class. Since my school is small, we have more one on one conversations about anything that is related to school which is awesome. The only problem is that they are not always available because they have other responsibilities like after school programs. For example, my AP spanish teacher is the coach of our running club. Other than that, the teachers make sure they have time for students to ask for help.', ""The resources of our school are fairly typical. Our school building is five floors, all of which are somewhat small. Our school at point was a Catholic school so there is still a chapel on the fourth floor, which we use for storage. The guidance counselors are invisible, I was not aware we even had one until I took my PSAT. The college prep here is excellent, especially our college bound counseler, who works extremely hard for every girl to be happy with where she goes. The tutoring here is decent, but only if you are in middle school or in the first two years of high school (and this is only peer tutoring). Once you get into your Junior and Senior year, there really aren't any tutoring options. Although, the teachers are always available to help you when needed. Parent involvement here is a joke, the PTA believes they run the school, and sadly they do. If there were no PTA, our school would be much better off. Nothing can get done because they waste the schools money on ridiculous things that do not even pan out in the end. The busing is fine since I live only 20 minutes away. However, NYC is huge and it could take you a while to get here, especially if there are train delays."", 'If you are interested in sports, please do not come here. Although they may say we have an abundance of sports, we simply do not. We have a few sports teams, but you never here of any competitions or games. We usually do not even play other teams. Our sports teams are basically nonexistent. We have one gym, which is not even attached to our school, it is across the street. Also, we have no locker rooms, no actual workout rooms. Our school does not even own the gym. The sports and fitness here are very poor.', ""The food at our school is decent, although I tend not to get it. Our school has the option to leave campus for your lunch period once you go into high school. This is a great option since we have many places around our school to go to. High schooler's tend to just go out for lunch and therefore it is usually only the middle schooler's that get school lunch. I, personally, haven't gotten school lunch in a couple years."", ""The only reason I have good things to say about my school, is because of the teachers I have had. Over my almost 7 years in this school, I have only had one bad teacher, who was simply too nice to teach high school. The teachers here have helped me in every way they possibly could. They respond to my emails on weekends, on week days, and usually extremely late at night as well. If you aren't happy with your grade, they are more than happy to help you to bring your grade up. They are accommodating and beyond caring, and empathetic. They want you to succeed, and help you do it."", 'This school is in a nice area, although the security guard is never at her desk. On top of that all, just about anyone can walk in and out of the school. Also, the ""guidance counselor""\'s husband walks in and out of the school whenever he feels the urge to. This is a large down fall for the safety of our girls since it is an all girls school. The faculty also tends to leave doors open around the school, so that anyone off the street could easily walk in. There is also some bullying apparent in the middle school, because of all of the diverse background. Overall, this school is decently safe, although for a school in New York City should have more safety measures in place.', 'We arent a big school, so yes there is limited space but we still manage to achieve our goal at hand when it gomes to athletics and that is recognition of what we can do without all of the space.', 'I enjoy the uniform because it takes away from bullying and the administration is alright i like the new principal she really wants to do things with the building and get more involvement with parents as well as students.', 'There is access to a computer in the CBI office or during class when a teacher request the cart.

Otherwise, the teachers found a way to create a strict yet fun learning environment. Other than the teachers, the whole faculty, when it came to the guidance counselors or the office workers, were very sweet and knowledgeable. All questions were asked at ease.

They have a great educational system however, my graduating class was not well-disiplined and the administration did not know how to properly deal with us as a group. I have learned a lot however, they could not find an appropriate teacher for my AP chemistry class and settled for a teacher that did not create an AP environment. Instead I felt like I was in middle school and did not receive adequate education in this one particular class. My anatomy class and teacher was outstanding and the program/curriculum for this class is the best it can be.', ""My experience as a theatre-loving student at Lenape has been amazing, but I wish that the theatre and arts department had more recognition and funding. The school does not fund the theatre department in any way, and it is up to the director of the production to manage finances and earnings from the previous year's ticket sales. Although the school very much values sports over the arts, we still manage to put on productions that captivate audiences every year. The academic atmosphere is rigorous, and most teachers care deeply about the education of their students. Grading is fair, and I personally haven't had many issues regarding grading and teachers. Lenape also offers a wide variety of sports, community service, environmental, business, and cultural clubs. Each student has a chance to develop themselves as well-rounded individuals through academics and the countless opportunities to get involved within the school and community."", 'For the most part, the teachers are very good and truly care about the students. There are many options for extracurricular activities and if one sees that an activity is not represented, new clubs can be made fairly easily. The administration tries its best for the students though may have a few lapses when it comes to understanding how the students will feel about  changes or may not fully explain the benefits or reasons for changes. Most of the students try and are good, but the experience can be tainted by the students who do not care and have generally bad attitudes about everything. ', 'The academics are just average.  Not a lot of electives offered when I was there, had a lot to learn when I got to college.', 'There is barely any diversity here.  Mostly all white people from the same middle class, it is a small school with mostly everyone being related to each other.', 'I felt safe at school because you had to buzz in and state your name and business before they let you into the school.  Then you went right into the office and had to show your ID and sign in before you could go anywhere else.  There are also security cameras and a security guard at the school at all times.', 'There are actually quite a few extracurricular at Lenape Valley and that is what I liked most about the school.  My favorite was a community service driven one called Interact because we got to go on trips and participate in making a difference.  I also liked Peer to Peer because it was a group of friendly students willing to help anyone.  Student Council was also fun because you got to participate in a lot of decision making for the school.', 'I made sure to get involved so that I had a really good time and joined sports and clubs so I could meet people with the same interests as me.', 'The teachers at the school are very approachable and kind for the most part but are not too worried about the quality of education they are providing.  Lots of busy work that does not necessarily pertain to what we are suppose to be learning about.', 'I feel very safe in my school and I can go to school everyday and not feel threatened', 'the clubs are a great thing in any school but I do wish there were more options of the different clubs you can choose from.', 'I am not really sure about the parental involvement at the school but when it comes to athletic games, especially football, A LOT of parents come out and support our athletic teams and it is such a great thing!', ""The teachers that I have had the past 4 years varied. The majority of the teachers I had were very outgoing and so helpful. I could go to those teachers anytime outside of class and they would be there, eager to help me. Some teachers made learning fun and making their class enjoyable while I did have a few teachers that I didn't really like their teaching style, but every teacher teaches differently. But in all I loved majority of my teachers and I have learned so much!""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""There aren't a whole lotta extra safety policies, but its not really necessary\r pretty safe school"", ""Of the sports I've participated in, soccer, football, and wrestling, the coaches were fun and very good.

If you are in the top ten percent, then that means you are utilizing the opportunities that the school provides to their potential. I am in the top three percent of my school, and from my view, it looks like 75% of the students in this school do not car about their grades or activities as much as I do. This difference only came as a hinder with guidance and in my regular classes, not my honors or AP courses. Regarding guidance, the department spends more time focusing on the ""bad"" kids than the ""good"" kids. I felt like my guidance counselor never had time for me. In my regular English class I had a teacher who clearly did not want to be there everyday, a teacher who was walk all over by immature students, a teacher who was ignorant, and a teacher played more movies of res than taught.There is ABSOLUTELY no school spirt what so ever and 90% of students are embarrassed to say they go to PV.', ""I love my high school, but this only applies to the classes I take (which are primarily honors and advanced placement). I've taken a few normal classes and either succeeded with no challenge whatsoever or dropped it to level up to AP. The honors program is rigorous and rewarding, but the normal classes aren't. There needs to be more of a balance, which is why I rate my school 3/5."", 'Passaic Valley High School is generally a good school filled with a lot of different people. I love the diversity in this school, with not only students, but teachers and other staff members as well. Most teachers are very helpful and caring towards their students. I wish to see the school spirit get better in the next couple years in this high school. It has a lot of potential, it just needs the students to want it.', ""Passaic Valley High School brings three small towns together and provides us all one big home that we're proud to be apart of. The teachers really made the 4 years of high school bearable. I'm glad I got the chance to be involved and take advantage of the opportunities this school gave me.

I always recommend this school to my neighbors who are in 8th grade and are looking for a best high school. This school is best for finding a good college.

SWMHS is located in a smallish town, pretty diverse student body. The school has recently installed and required metal detectors upon entrance along with a swipe of your student ID card. While this stirred up trouble with the students, surely it did promote more safety due to the many and recent school shootings through out the country. The teachers are good for the most part, most of them genuinely care for their students. Sports are fun, sometimes the football is good sometimes it isn't really just luck of the draw.. Would this be my first pick for my children to attend? No. Does it beat other schools? Yes. SWHMS is slightly above average."", 'Sayreville HS is a very diverse school with unique individuals. It has its ups and downs like many schools do', ""One thing that can be agreed on is the prominent diversity at SWMHS and countless extracurriculars that are open to students to encourage school involvement.  The environment is pretty comfortable; almost everyone is very accepting and open, so it's fairly easy to make friends. There are some issues with staffing and money distribution though, so I think that the school should prioritize making students' learning as efficient as possible, given that it's a bit understaffed, and a bit too much money goes to the football team.  Otherwise, it's a decent school to go to, though for people moving to the area, there are definitely much better high schools around here."", 'Sayreville War Memorial has a lot to offer for kids looking to try new things. There is something for everyone there and it is a welcoming environment.', 'sayreville, i wouldnt say its a fun school, there are no fun events such as pink outs,  etc. I would say what would make our school a better school would be things such as senior parking spaces (painting) and more fun school events such as pink outs, etc, so everyone can be involved. A better school spirit week would be nice. our education isnt bad.', 'As a parent I would like to see that the kids are preparing the students for college. There are a few staff that do not teach well.  Administration and staff should be more involved with their students.', 'I liked that Sayreville War Memorial offers a lot of clubs and interests for students.

The teachers are very helpful and want to see their students succeed.', 'I would say my high school experience is average. There’s nothing that stood out except for Friday night lights on the football field.', 'The school had many rigorous classes and various different clubs to participate in. I enjoyed all of the amenities offered and loved its advanced way of teaching.', 'Prioritizes sports over academics. Can afford to spend thousands for the football team but cannot even afford AC.', 'My experience attending my high school was a relatively good experience due to my broad groups of friends and my teacher that made my courses interesting with their many assignments and fun teaching styles. I joined choir and theatre productions all throughout high school. I made and maintained friendships with people that share similar interests to me. I even built positive relationships with my teachers over the years. The staff was always very helpful during stressful periods and never ignored any problems that may have circulated the school. While being educated, I began to look at a career in education as an option. I will always look back, fondly, on my time Sayreville War Memorial High School because it shaped me into the intelligent and open-minded person that I am today.', 'I enjoyed being able to see everyone who I grew up with graduate with me. We all progressed from Elementary school to high school in a succinct manner. As well, Sayreville War Memorial did its best to give its students a well-rounded experience within high school, with the various sports teams, after-school activities, and community builders to engage with the people of the town.', 'It is a great school. More than 85% of the student body are active in aports and/or clubs. Kids are respectful and polite!', 'I would like for the school to offer additional languages other than Spanish and French.  My parents family is from Italy and it would have been nice to learn Italian as my foreign language.  When we talk about Diversity, we should be able to not just learn about other cultures, but be able to learn the languages of these cultures as well.  I do hope that Rowan University offers Italian, but if not, I would love to sample other languages.  In my field of study, Paleontology, I will need to speak and read other languages, so i feel that if it had started in High School, I would have had a better advantage.', 'Although this school has drugs, this was my first time coming to public school, this school is a good school. It barely has any bullying, but there are physical fights. The people in this school are really nice. No one judges you for what you wear. I came from a privet Islamic school and i wear long stuff and no one makes fun of me like other schools would do. the principal is so nice and he is trying to stop the drugs in this school.', ""This school needs a lot of improvement. When it comes to events or anything academics, this school can be extremely  unorganized. Some of the teachers take forever to put grades but most of them are efficient The lockers, bathrooms, and gym locker rooms are outdated. You are required to pay class due which add to $50 for all 4 years. Besides the negative, There are some good things. The guidance office is very helpful when come to college and personal issues, The food they serve at lunch is pretty decent and we do offer many clubs. The rules here are not really that strict but if they are broken over and over again will have some serious consequences.  In a whole i do wish i attended a better school but it wasn't the worst school experience I've ever had. There are some really great teachers in this school that will help in every step of the way Academically and personally."", 'Would like lunch food to be better & better rules. I like how some teachers actually care about making you succeed. Just wish senior could go out for lunch. etc.', 'When I entered the high school I wasn’t in the dark because the freshman class was given an orientation.

The teachers are good for the most part, most of them genuinely care for their students. Sports are fun, sometimes the football is good sometimes it isn't really just luck of the draw..

There are some issues with staffing and money distribution though, so I think that the school should prioritize making students' learning as efficient as possible, given that it's a bit understaffed, and a bit too much money goes to the football team.

Gaynor McCown Expeditionary Learning School,"['The teachers are selfish and only care about themselves. The kids are alll mean teachers dont dicipline and take control of the kids. The sports teams are terrible because of terrible coaches. Principle is terrible. Teachers are clearly blind. On the day of service trip I was getting garbage shoved in my face by my classmates and they dont even punish or discipline the kids and act like they dont see it when they really do.', 'Gaynor Mccown High School is an amazing school with many different opportunities that have a great hands-on learning experience. The school is made up of approximately  500 students, which allows teachers to get to know the students. There are also many opportunities for students to get one on one time with teachers to further help them in their education. Also since this school is an expeditionary learning school, they go on many fields works to learn about a case study they are working on. During breaks, such as winter break or spring break, the school goes on overseas trips to experience different cultures,(this is optional for the student). the school has visited many parts of Europe and this year they went to Japan. Overall Gaynor Mccown Expeditionary learning school is a unique experience and I would recommend it to students who are willing to try new things and like to work in a smaller working environment.', 'Gaynor Mccown was a great school when I used to attend it. All students from all sorts of backgrounds were welcomed and respected. There were a wide range of school activities that I personally enjoyed taking part in.', ""My life would not be the same if I did not attend this school. Some may disagree, but it's really what you make of it. The small population of this school gives you the opportunity to really get to know everyone-- I mean everyone. The teachers are seriously beyond wonderful. As long as you do your homework and are respectful, they seriously become more like your close friends. As an alum, I still keep in touch and even sometimes get lunch with old teachers. McCown is a safe environment where diversity is constantly celebrated; everyone is accepted. I cannot rave enough about this place. I miss it constantly. Thanks for the best 4 years of my life."", 'From my four years attending Gaynor McCown, I’ve learned to step more out of my comfort zone. Participating in “crew”, and intensives week gave me a better insight into the school community, as well as bringing me closer to various peers. The small class sizes allows the teacher to be more connected with each student, as they put the effort in to guarantee their students will succeed. Most of the teachers create this environment to challenge us, in order to expand our range of thinking, without “spoon-feeding” us answers. Although we do lack extracurricular activities, if one is willing to commit to the offered clubs/sports, then it will benefit them in the future. Due to the small class sizes, it leads to a lack of variety in AP classes, but the ones offered are beneficial to students who may want to pursue a career in that possible field.', 'I am currently a senior at this school and I have appreciated the ways of teaching her. It is a smaller school which I feel is much better since there is a better relationship with the staff and more time placed on students. Instead of getting lost in a big crowd of students you know what is going on in the school community. However it does lack extra curricular activites, there are some but it could be better.', ""It's a small school that allowed me to grow into the young adult I am today. I have lasting friendships with women of different ethnicities."", ""Attending Gaynor Mccown will ensure you an interesting High School experience. Being an Expeditionary Learning School the curriculum and student engagement differs from most public schools as students have more opportunity to collaborate with one another. The school's size allows for relationships to flourish between student and teacher leading to a more friendly and comfortable atmosphere. With several opportunities for students to leave the classroom and explore Staten Island or go out of the country, Gaynor Mccown provides a unique  High School experience. However facilities around the building are a bit lacking along with the food. The school also did a lot of fundraising to get activities done, meaning not every event was able to be done due to a lack of funding in some instances."", 'This school was excellent because you get all the help you need, and you are able to roam the school without being bullied. The teachers are really friendly, and its a fun experience for many students that have applied here.', 'Overall gaynor mccown is a very good school and prepares you very well for college. The teachers and staff are always willing to help you out with anything at anytime.', 'The teachers and students are extremely respectful to each other, and always help each other out. Whenever you need any kind of help there is always people you can talk to in the building.', 'I like how small the school is and how friendly everyone is. I would like to see better school programs and clubs.', 'environment Gaynor was a small school which made it very easy to  connect with teachers staff and students, great staff, good education and friendly environment.', 'I am currently an alumnus at G.M.E.L.S. I was a part of the very first four graduating classes. Class of 2015. One thing that I liked about G.M.E.L.S was the student to teacher ratio. The classroom sizes are extremely small which gave you a lot of one on one time with the teachers any time you needed help. My graduating class was 123 students. As well as the diversity. My favorite thing about the school was even though we went to a uniformed school, we got to wear our uniform the way we wanted to. We could put our own individuality, style, and flare into the way we wore it. One thing that I can say I would like to change about that school while attending was there was not much extracurricular activities, clubs, or different organizations offered. There were very little options when it came to doing things outside of school work. All in all, the school was extremely sanitary and I indeed felt safe.', 'In my four years at Mccown, I have created the best memories. I have had the best teachers to help push me towards my academic goals.', ""I love how my school has intensives week where we don't need to do classwork and just have fun for a week. This is a deserved respite in the middle or end of March when there is usually no breaks. For example, this year, my senior year, I had the burger intensive where I go to go to multiple burger places to try their burgers and understand how these burger places made their burgers. Such as how they mixed their patties and all the other condiments that they put inside. I also enjoy how my school is very big on community service and we have many service projects that contribute to a worthy cause. For instance, my school hosts an annual John's Pasta Party that raises money for survivors of cancer to a college education. Overall, I loved my four years at Gaynor McCown ELS even though it was not my first choice of high school. I do not regret my choice in staying at McCown and I hope others will feel the same way. McCown has given me many memories that I would not trade for anything."", ""After attending this school for 4 years, I have mostly negatives to say unfortunately. first, since this is a government public school,  don't expect much.

The school is made up of approximately  500 students, which allows teachers to get to know the students. There are also many opportunities for students to get one on one time with teachers to further help them in their education. Also since this school is an expeditionary learning school, they go on many fields works to learn about a case study they are working on. During breaks, such as winter break or spring break, the school goes on overseas trips to experience different cultures,(this is optional for the student). the school has visited many parts of Europe and this year they went to Japan. Overall Gaynor Mccown Expeditionary learning school is a unique experience and I would recommend it to students who are willing to try new things and like to work in a smaller working environment.', 'Gaynor Mccown was a great school when I used to attend it. All students from all sorts of backgrounds were welcomed and respected. There were a wide range of school activities that I personally enjoyed taking part in.', ""My life would not be the same if I did not attend this school. Some may disagree, but it's really what you make of it. The small population of this school gives you the opportunity to really get to know everyone-- I mean everyone. The teachers are seriously beyond wonderful. As long as you do your homework and are respectful, they seriously become more like your close friends. As an alum, I still keep in touch and even sometimes get lunch with old teachers. McCown is a safe environment where diversity is constantly celebrated; everyone is accepted. I cannot rave enough about this place. I miss it constantly. Thanks for the best 4 years of my life."", 'From my four years attending Gaynor McCown, I’ve learned to step more out of my comfort zone. Participating in “crew”, and intensives week gave me a better insight into the school community, as well as bringing me closer to various peers. The small class sizes allows the teacher to be more connected with each student, as they put the effort in to guarantee their students will succeed. Most of the teachers create this environment to challenge us, in order to expand our range of thinking, without “spoon-feeding” us answers. Although we do lack extracurricular activities, if one is willing to commit to the offered clubs/sports, then it will benefit them in the future. Due to the small class sizes, it leads to a lack of variety in AP classes, but the ones offered are beneficial to students who may want to pursue a career in that possible field.', 'I am currently a senior at this school and I have appreciated the ways of teaching her. It is a smaller school which I feel is much better since there is a better relationship with the staff and more time placed on students. Instead of getting lost in a big crowd of students you know what is going on in the school community.

I have lasting friendships with women of different ethnicities."", ""Attending Gaynor Mccown will ensure you an interesting High School experience. Being an Expeditionary Learning School the curriculum and student engagement differs from most public schools as students have more opportunity to collaborate with one another. The school's size allows for relationships to flourish between student and teacher leading to a more friendly and comfortable atmosphere. With several opportunities for students to leave the classroom and explore Staten Island or go out of the country, Gaynor Mccown provides a unique  High School experience. However facilities around the building are a bit lacking along with the food. The school also did a lot of fundraising to get activities done, meaning not every event was able to be done due to a lack of funding in some instances."", 'This school was excellent because you get all the help you need, and you are able to roam the school without being bullied.

I would like to see better school programs and clubs.', 'environment Gaynor was a small school which made it very easy to  connect with teachers staff and students, great staff, good education and friendly environment.', 'I am currently an alumnus at G.M.E.L.S. I was a part of the very first four graduating classes. Class of 2015. One thing that I liked about G.M.E.L.S was the student to teacher ratio. The classroom sizes are extremely small which gave you a lot of one on one time with the teachers any time you needed help. My graduating class was 123 students. As well as the diversity. My favorite thing about the school was even though we went to a uniformed school, we got to wear our uniform the way we wanted to. We could put our own individuality, style, and flare into the way we wore it. One thing that I can say I would like to change about that school while attending was there was not much extracurricular activities, clubs, or different organizations offered. There were very little options when it came to doing things outside of school work. All in all, the school was extremely sanitary and I indeed felt safe.', 'In my four years at Mccown, I have created the best memories. I have had the best teachers to help push me towards my academic goals.', ""I love how my school has intensives week where we don't need to do classwork and just have fun for a week. This is a deserved respite in the middle or end of March when there is usually no breaks. For example, this year, my senior year, I had the burger intensive where I go to go to multiple burger places to try their burgers and understand how these burger places made their burgers. Such as how they mixed their patties and all the other condiments that they put inside. I also enjoy how my school is very big on community service and we have many service projects that contribute to a worthy cause. For instance, my school hosts an annual John's Pasta Party that raises money for survivors of cancer to a college education. Overall, I loved my four years at Gaynor McCown ELS even though it was not my first choice of high school. I do not regret my choice in staying at McCown and I hope others will feel the same way. McCown has given me many memories that I would not trade for anything."", ""After attending this school for 4 years, I have mostly negatives to say unfortunately. first, since this is a government public school,  don't expect much.

They were a wonderful experience because they had split weeks between internships and school, giving everyone a chance to see what it is like in the real working world.

The staff is compassionate and brilliant, the administration is benevolent and sharp. Best school I have ever been apart of.', 'This High School offers amazing opportunities. When I transferred here the opportunities started flooding me. This school is based out of classes and internships. I interned at West Chelsea Veterinary Hospital where I started as a intern when I was 16 and was hired to work there too. I observed surgeries, learned how X-rays are completed, post- and pre-surgical procedures. Teachers are really helpful and engaged to the topics. Staff members are incredibly helpful and friendly. This high school is my second home. I was president of the Student Government, this was fascinating since I also met with staff members on how to make  the school enhance more than what it already is. Moreover, when I still need help, I seek help from the teachers and the principal. This High School has helped me in my academic career, seeking internships, and how to empower myself mentally. Foremost, City-As-School, was the bridge to my future goal.', 'Ability to learn in an internship environment and take college classes. I was able to go on an expense paid trip to Denmark and learn at The New School for Social Research.

I learned how to make pottery at an internship from the school and I loved everything about it', 'I love city as school . The people there make you feel great, they help you with everything.  They push you to be the best. The only thing I would change is having more clubs in the school.', 'My school is a very unique school and I love every thing about it . It gives us all a chance to recover from anything that we may have messed up in our previous schools and it gives us the option to pick and choose what we want to do.

For example, in the fall, I had experienced being in multiple clubs such as the Astronomy Club and the 3-D printing club, while my sister joined the field hockey team.  In the winter, my sister and I both joined the winter track team, and now we are on the softball team this spring.  My experience with Norwalk High has been far from disappointing, and has exceeded my expectations of how much fun high school can be.', 'The system is okay, teachers are resourceful, students are annoying, many opportunities, eventful calender, and LOTS of college trips. The NECA program is widely known now and the NECA program is great.', ""What you put into Norwalk High School is what you get out. There is nobody there who is going to help you out or push you towards your college goals except yourself. The teachers range from absolutely terrible to great, with most teachers falling in the middle to bottom half of that scale. The student body isn't very tightly knit, but it's not difficult to find a friend group that suits you. Overall, Norwalk High School is average, not shining bright in too many areas, but not coming up short too often either."", 'I really loved how hands on the teachers are. The teacher I have had truly care about your education and make sure you have a good understanding of what is going on. I wish that they were given more credit for all of the hard work they put into us. One thing I wish would change to improve our school would be the cleanliness of our school, other than that I have loved my high school experience at Norwalk High.', 'I have really enjoyed all the programs they have to offer. I would like better communication with the staff.', 'I am pleased with the fact that Norwalk High presents honor students with the ability to indulge in various AP classes as well as seek extra help after school when needed. Although the classroom basis is poor at times, those who seek guidance outside of school hours such as extra help are significantly more prepared as they are the ones reaching out and getting results. I would love to see more school spirit as a whole for this school. Football, soccer, and field hockey games are always packed with spirit, though when it comes to Pep Rallies, the spirit lacks significantly.', 'My experience is great, the school it self is very great. They have a great program called NECA that offers a great learning experience.', 'A good high school where most teachers are willing to help students get ready for college. Teachers are highly educated in their field and classes are run smoothly. There are many clubs and sports that allow every student to feel included in the high school life. This school also has great diversity and students and staff are respectful.', 'It was an alright school with okay people. Some teachers seemed to care for their students while others were there to just get their pay and leave. The classes were not that hard, if you needed help, the right teacher would be able to tutor you. Lunch was alright, the food could have been better. Security was always good at keeping fights to a minimum. Should probably help more with college readiness.', ""Honestly I hate this school. I feel like my high school experience would have been ten times better if I wasn't at this school. It is diverse, which is nice. But the school itself and it's facilities are not very nice. They also barely helped me prepare for college, I felt very rushed and confused when the time came to send in applications. 2 stars, maybe 3 sometimes"", 'Not fun, never get any help, library closes early, forced to make the wrong choices, needs TO BE CLEANED DESPERATLY', ""Overall experience was very well. The teachers were intelligent and the staff was hardworking. Some rules I believe do not correlate with preparation for college. Norwalk high doesn't teach time management, which is a very important skill to have acquired before college.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Most academic teachers are okay, with some mediocre ones and some exceptional ones too. The art teachers are for the most part great, and depending on your major will really help you become a better artist since they all are required to have worked in industry. This is not the case the the school administration—who are a joke. The admins do not have any art background, resulting a rift between them and students. Also, the facilities such as bathrooms and locker rooms are filthy due to neglect by students and janitorial staff.', ""The school is is very clean and the staff is always willing to help when needed.

This school is very accepting and open to all types of people no matter race, gender, or sexuality, and it offers excellent opportunities for people to go to conventions and sell their art such as mocca fest and comic con. Though the principal can be strict on implementing DOK and accountable talk as well as people who can teach in this type of manner, most teachers are good at what they do and help you get the resources you need in order to be successful.', 'the school is a great school, although core classes such as english maths and sciences are not much more focused than the art classes.', 'Art & Design isn\'t exactly known for consistency. There\'s a clear lack of communication between staff and it shows through our academic classes. Some teachers here (mostly the art teachers) are really amazing and genuinely love their job, but most of the academic teachers seem lost most of the time. I have a particular teacher for ""Creative Writing"" who didn\'t know she was teaching a creative writing elective until the second week of school. Even though our art teachers are great, unlike the website claimed when I applied your major doesn\'t seem to help you build your college portfolio at all.  If you\'ve been in disorganized high schools and don\'t mind them, go right ahead. However, know you\'re not getting anything exceptional outside of some resources from the art program. The counselors (especially for seniors) aren\'t really helpful with communicating with students or getting them to their goal credits for their ideal college. So, pick your poison really.', 'Excellent resources for those interested in various forms of the arts. Lots of AP classes to. Wish they had more to select from.

Recently, our school has strengthened its emphasis on academics by implementing a more accessible AP classes program. This gives students an easier opportunity to challenge themselves and gain a higher education.

There are lots of clubs and the school is small but that means the community is more united. Some aspects like sports seem a little underdeveloped, but I don’t play them so I can’t judge too harshly. My only gripes are that in some cases classmates are extremely disruptive and some teachers have trouble controlling them or just won’t, and like many schools in NY there does seem to be Liberal bias. But overall, this school does what it needs to provide a good and fulfilling education.', ""I have been at East West School of International Studies since middle school because it is a middle and high school. Considering there is a lack of school spirit and sports games the school itself is average. In addition, the school's academics is the main focus but there is no student activities that get people involved in the school itself."", 'the people are nice there! when I first come to east-west, I was not familiar with English so I refuse to communicate. the teacher gives me personal help, and encourage me a lot. the peers are willing to answer any question from you, too.', 'East West is a small school that consists of students from grades 6-12 and is shared with another middle school. This school prioritizes safety and makes sure that students are safe. The majority of people that go here are Asian, but it is pretty diverse.

Overall, the teachers are very knowledgeable and make sure that students get the help they need in class.', 'Compared to my first high school, East-West is unique in its extremely small school population, with about 100 students per grade. While some may argue a low population is bad, I believe it helps students build stronger bonds. In addition, the teachers are quite friendly and offer a variety of extra help such as tutoring. However, I would like to see more AP classes offered at the school and more sports teams. Overall, East-West is a friendly and safe environment that emphasizes academic success.', 'I’m a new 9th grader and overall the school is alright. Here are a few things to note if you’re thinking about enrolling:• The lunch food is BAD. REALLY BAD.• If you get Judo, ask to change the course. Unless you’ve already done it in some capacity, the material is pretty advanced, and several students (including myself) who are inexperienced have gotten injured several times. • Quite a few of the 9th graders who went there for middle school operate in cliques and are straight up unfriendly people who look down upon the new freshmen. Most are very nice, though • PupilPath will either be your best friend or worst enemy. I’ve done all of my global assignments and have gotten high scores on assignments and quizzes but I have a 65. I don’t know if it’s an error but this is just so you know.• Clubs can be competitive to join. For example, we had to audition for Kpop club.', 'The school is small so it helped me realize that i dont like small schools. The fact that the school was small hindered me from triving socially, thus making my experience moderate. my experience got better since the people i know there are generally nice and welcoming. However, academically, the school is extremely good!', 'I feel like ever since I came into East-West my grades has just been going up and never is coming down. East-West is always prepared for everyone to go to the college they all dreamed of. Our college counselor will go far and beyond for us seniors to graduate and go to college.

Most are very nice, though • PupilPath will either be your best friend or worst enemy. I’ve done all of my global assignments and have gotten high scores on assignments and quizzes but I have a 65.

The Michael J. Petrides School,"['I hated the Michael J. Petrides experience from top to bottom. The school is small, dirty and they close the restroom facilities for inadequate reasons. The education programs were mediocre and they only have basic electives like drama & art. But I would say those are filler classes and we BARLEY partake in any activity of the sort. Their sport programs and coaches were below average. The kids from lower grades are poorly managed, They are rude and the adults act like they didn\'t see anything when asked about their rudeness. Kids get away with smoking and other activities. And keep in mind, it\'s a small school WITH CHILDREN so it is easy to catch these kids in their ""activities"". The AP classes gave me stress and anxeity attacks, but luckily I made it through in the end. It was NOT worth it though.', 'This is a K-12 school and is like family. You grow up with your friends fromKindergarten through graduation. Friendships that last forever. Teachers are like an extended family.', 'I have attended Petrides for nine years . The teachers do not have the students best interest at. The teacher often do not assist in solving student issues, the guidance consular is not professional at all, she often plays favorites amongst the students.  The students are a mixed of different people, there are many different personalities within them. There is a lack of involvement and inclusion, students of color don’t have clubs or events that celebrates them.', 'My school is very unique since it offers a PreK-12 education. Petrides has been my second home and has exposed me to a variety of experiences that have shaped me into the student athlete that I am today.', 'Petrides was a fun school open to many changes that enhanced student learning but, the school itself lacked aspects such as job placement for upperclassmen and proper student support.', ""I've been a student at Petrides since Kindergarten, and I'm happy to say that being a part of Petrides all these years was the best decision for me. Petrides has given me so many opportunities that I will forever be grateful for. Getting involved at Petrides is the best part because it's honestly quite easy to gain leadership positions for activities and things that you are ambitious about. I've gained such great friendships and memories at Petrides, that I will cherish all my life. The only thing about Petrides that I dislike is the academics. Academics are not rigorous and most AP teachers don't care if you pass their AP exam or not! With the new PROSE program, sure OAT is fun and all, but high school at Petrides has literally become a joke for many students. Overall though, I definitely love Petrides, and if you're a hard-working kid who wants to have fun, Petrides is the place for you!"", 'I have been at the Michael J. Petrides School since I was 6 years old and it has been a wonderful experience. Majority of the teachers at Petrides really take the time to understand and connect with the students. Our principal has recently implemented the PROSE project on high school students so that we get the college experience. I have to say, Petrides cares a lot about the future of every student because our college adviser goes through all the steps into college and career searching. Our school lacks respect in regards to facilities and peers sometimes. I think that the high school aspect of Petrides can improve, there should be consequences for bad actions and suspending a kid is not always the answer to a problem that occurs many times. Overall, Petrides is a school that has positive feelings to it, the campus is beautiful and welcoming, especially during the spring. Sports are highly encouraged here and it is a place to have fun while you are learning.', 'There are advantages and disadvantages to this school being a K-12 school. The advantage is that once you get in, you have not worried about having to switch schools going from Elementary-Middle, or Middle-High School. Being a K-12 school is also a disadvantage, because the older kids are usually mixing with the little ones in hallways. Something Petrides should do is designate certain buildings, or certain floors for each grade so that they do not run into others older or younger than them. Lastly, Petrides needs to stop accepting in kids that were expelled/suspended from other schools. That adds a terrible reputation to the school.', 'Teachers a great when it comes to teaching. They listen to your problems if you have any. The students are sometimes nice but they need to work on being respectful to teachers and workers in the school. Other than that it is a good school.', 'I have attended the Michael J. Petrides School for  13 memorable years. Sticking along the same group of peers for over 10 years creates a safe comfortable environment in the school. As years have progressed the school makes a great effort to intertwine the older students with the young to set a definitive standard to aspire to once they become of age. With the constant flow of fresh faces in the high school the era of role models for the younger students has been overshadowed through a few characters the school could very well improve on their disciplining tactics.Rather than awarded those who have done wrong with numerous second chances due to their good nature the school could very well have a more no nonsense ideology in certain cases in which help the overall wellbeing of students in their entirety.', 'For the 4 years going to this school, I’ve always felt at home. All the teachers and staff are very welcoming and care very much about you. Principal is very professional and fair. The deans and assistant principals can be quick to correct kids who are misbehaving or loitering in the hallways. I’m conclusion they are making petrides great again.', 'The Michael J. Petrides school is a very organized complex . The school provides students with strong education and support.

The teachers will work with you to help you in any way possible, when they feel like your starting to fall off they are there to catch you and help you with everything. The school is very diverse and you meet many people from everywhere and it is a good atmosphere the guidance counselor is on top of everything trying to make sure they help in any way possible. One thing I would like to see change is to clean the bathrooms quickly when it smells or someone throws up or is very sick.', ""I went to Bellport Senior High School for all four years of my high school journey. The faculty and staff have the students' best wishes at heart, wanting them to succeed in each course they teach. However there are a some instructors that, whether they realize it or not, still treat their students as children, as appose to young adults with complex lives. To remedy this I would like a sort of method for teachers to understand their students' lives."", ""Bellport High School was a good experience for me meeting new people(teachers and students). I had a lot of fun in many of my classes from freshman year to my senior year. I enjoyed playing sports in this school too. Baseball is my main and only sport that I played and I had a lot of fun playing it. There were maybe two field trips which I have gone on about every year, but I wish I could go on more. There are many sports in this school that I could played, but not the ones I wanted. I kind of wish there was a swimming program in this school. Overall, my experience at this school was great! The most thing I'm going to miss from this school is all the friends I made and the experiences I had."", ""I have attended Bellport Senior High School  for 4 years and every year it gets better. I love the way the teachers teach and try to make sure you get the concept of the lesson. They don't give up on you they take time out of their personal lives just to help he students. You can tell hat in this school they really care about the students lives and goals; they will do just abut anything they can to help you achieve the goals. The guidance counselors also make the  school great , you can tell that thy love helping us young adults find and achieve our goals. they dot just come to work for the paycheck they actually care."", 'depending on the course that was taken would determine the difficulty. for example an AP course was more challenging than a regular course. but not everyone took AP courses and the regular courses were the bare minimum.', 'the school is very diverse.', 'there are a wide range of clubs and activities for students to get involved in. however they are not taken that seriously past the club fair.', 'i personally only enjoyed the few teachers that went above and beyond and the arts programs and activities. other than that i did not want to be there ever.', 'there are some teachers that are exceptional and then there are some teacher that are mediocre at best. there is not i between.', ""The school does its best to maintain the health and safety of the student body, however there are some areas that need work. I believe that the school is well equipped against external threats (i.e. non students and faculty) but, I also believe it is left vulnerable to any threats that are already in the school.( students and faculty) Additionally, I've noticed that some classroom are hardly ever cleaned and garbage and papers will be left lying around my desk for weeks. The school nurse may also be a problem, because its often very crowded with students who are both healthy and sick. And those sick students are not separated and could possibly be contagious and infect others."", ""At my school there are plenty of clubs and extracurricular activities to be apart of. We have several clubs for minorities such as the Gay-Straight alliance, a World of Difference and the Women of Excellence club. We also have clubs focused on a student's academic future such as Math, Science and National Honor Societies as well as the Future Business Leaders and Teachers of America club. The majority  of these clubs are funded  mostly by its members which means that they get out however much they put in.(Fundraisers and competitions) And if students are not very motivated to raise money for their club, which is hardly ever the case, then they will not receive any significant funding and their club will accomplish nothing."", ""The quality of teachers in my school is exceptional, most teachers are very approachable and I see many students going to them for advice on academic topics as well as personal dilemmas. Occasionally they get backed up with grading and students don't get their work back right away but they're always straight forward with us and treat us like the young adults were are supposed to be growing up to. This year our principal took time out of his busy schedule to read 130 letters from the Career and Financial Management class filled with suggestions on how to make the school better. He even came into several class and directly addressed any questions or suggestions we might have left out.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Through the people I have interacted and became friends with, I have been educated on international topics and was taught many different aspects of different cultures. You can see people from all different backgrounds at Dewey. Also, the staff here in the school is amazing. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Whenever I needed help, I could ask many people and they would not hesitate to help me or other students. The staff treat every student at Dewey respectfully and they are always happy to see students. The coaches for the teams also are amazing. They create a bond with each and every student on and off the court. However, some thing that I would like to see change in my school is the commitment that students have for the clubs.

In the Senior year, the college counselor help student to plan for their college, like financial stuff. Another thing that I like about is the clubs. John Dewey High School had a lot of clubs. One of the club I really like about is the video game club, because in the video game club, there was no pressure and relax.One thing I will encourage the school should improve is the food.

But as I moved on to the next grade and now that I'm a senior I see that the school doesn't help with college readiness as much meaning that they don't really do much to help prepare for college . The school does't promote historically black colleges as they should which isn't fair because the students don't know anything about them.

The teachers also tries to use various teaching styles to understand which way the students can learn the best. They also try to incorporate real life examples when they are teaching the lessons. Some of the teachers are good at replying their emails, and a few are open to help students outside of classrooms. The consistency in grading is very good, since the teachers grade the work as soon as possible, and give great feed back.

All classes are extremely beneficial and the way that the lessons are taught help every student understand the class clearly. At the school they have a couple of teachers that deal with college readiness. They help the students go on college tours and help them with their college applications. The school has many college tours around the country, and some have trips to different countries.

One of the main reasons why I wanted to go to this school was because of how small it is.

The wifi is terrible and the school/board of ed is always constantly watching what sites students go on and the literally block everything. You can barely google something without it being blocked and youtube hardly works.

Going there has set me up for success.', 'I was able to push myself academically but the school was very strict on behavior.

The safety of the school is good. However, the food was and still is horrible.', ""Coney Island Preparatory Public School is one of the best schools out there. The school really strives for their students. From the 5th grade our main focus was college. We've visited countless colleges and have countless opportunities. Every year, the school offers a select few students, in their Sophomore and Junior year, the ability to study abroad or participate in a precollege program. Personally, I have been to Johns Hopkins University(Engineering Innovation: an engineering precollege program that covered many types of engineering within a month) and the University of Michigan(ArcStart: an architecture program). The school even has a course called College and Career Readiness that teaches us about college and life and helps us apply to colleges and get everything we need in order."", 'Decent small-sized school, though there does seem to be a huge bias when it comes to politicization of work.

Were it not for them, I wouldn't have thought of college being my number one priority, for I come from a low income family and only ever thought of going to work. However, the school does have its faults ranging from an awfully strict behavioural code to inexperienced teachers. Even so, they get the job done with getting students to college."", 'The curriculum at Coney Island Prep High School is very rigorous and all of the teachers make every minute count. The teachers go out of their way to make sure all of the students are understanding the curriculum and will stay after school, up to 8PM just to make sure the student understands everything they need in order to be successful.', ""The school is not that diverse, as 50.1% of the are African American, and Islamophobia is a big problem here. The teachers who are biased towards other students are kept while great teachers that are fair usually get the boot. The only great thing about the school has to be the College Readiness. The school removed all clubs and activities in the 2015-16 school year. When it comes to the safety of the students, the teachers usually stand by unless it is a one sided fight, not to mention the school does not have a nurse. The school culture is good, seeing as the main focus here is to go to college. The sport teams are based off of the coach's bias instead of actual skill, and the school goes against the same school every game. The food is by far the worst aspect of the school, the food often comes destroyed or late, and grades 5-8 have to eat in their classrooms, instead of a cafeteria."", ""At first, I absolutely hated the school. The hours were way too long for me and it was too strict. Many of my friends started to leave the school but within the next few months, they were right back where they started. There's no school like mine. Although the hours are long and it's strict, the teachers know what they're doing. The way we are taught is amazing and everyone has faith in each other. Being the first graduating class meant we had it the worst but we turned out to be great students growing into adults."", ""Coney Island Prep has opened many doors for me. Doors that ordinary public schools in my district wouldn't have been able to. With opportunities to study abroad and attend a precollege program come high expectations. Coney Island Prep holds us to high standards, which sometimes causes a limitation on freedom. I wished that the student body had more of a say in our school policies. However CIP has seen us mature for the better and has prepared us for the future ahead, college."", 'A school that genuinely cares for its students.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,,,

There are many sports such as basketball, baseball, volleyball, track and field, and even fencing. We also have many events and activites happen in the school like cook-offs, henna tattoos and gay pride day. One thing that could have used improvement were the cleanliness of the bathrooms but after the first two years of being in the school that issue had already been resolved.

Currently we have two, Web design and Video production. There have been talks about adding new program like per-engineering but I'm not sure. Honestly, when I was in freshmen year, I thought the school was bad and was thinking about transferring. I don't know why I stayed but I'm glad I did. Over the three years the school changed significantly. Mind you the school is fairly new, like 10-11 years old. I kind of envy the coming freshmen as they have more things than I didn't have."", ""Information technology has come a long way since I was a freshman, They have increased the number of AP classes and got some really good teachers. Overall I had a good experience however the school is not very clear to freshman with it's CTE program which I learned the hard way because my CTE program, Apple, was cut. This is and the national honor society are many of the cons of this school because the national honor society was really a big mess and very few people are graduating with NHS. The friends you make here however will be in everyone of your good memories when you look back through your time at this school so I do recommend you give it a chance."", 'A small school, but a very friendly environment.

I've made great friends, met amazing teachers who have pushed me to higher levels and learned yet more on subjects I expected less off. I have great relationships with faculty here and everyone is treated with upmost respect and equality. This is a small school that is yet developing, but based on the limitations this school has budget-wise, I know there can be so much more added here. I honestly enjoy being here, I feel at home with people who aren't crazy, fight-picking nor reckless.

Glen Cove High School isn't the nicest school, but the GCHS community is something you cant find anywhere else."", 'High School here I had a good time because i surrounded my self with good people and it was easy to get close with teachers and they helped me with a lot.', 'Glen Cove High School is actually quite enjoyable. Their teachers are actually quite good and often seem to go above and beyond for the students.', 'One of Glen Cove High School’s biggest issues is building safety. This year the auditorium stage lights (which were supposed to be secure) fell and nearly rushed students practicing for the school play. The library’s ceiling tiles collapsed and a light in the gym fell and started a fire, and the gym had to be renovated. The list goes on and on. Hopefully the school budget will be passed with much needed renovations soon.Despite all of this GCHS is still a great school in a variety of ways. Most of our teachers are very passionate about their jobs, especially our music teachers. Our select chorale is one of the best in New York. My favorite part of the high school is our unique TV Studio that other schools in the surrounding area lack. Students record and report for “GCTV Friday Morning News” and learn how to edit and create videos. The school is very supportive, diverse and inclusive to students of every background.', 'Overall, my experience at Glen Cove High School has been great. There are a diverse amount of clubs that are open to the students and I wish I had been able to join more. The teachers are great and make time for students to ensure we understand material and achieve the highest grade possible. The administrators care a great deal about us students, our opinions, and showing school pride anyway possible. In my senior year a bond was proposed to make various renovations in all the Glen Cove school districts to create a safer environment and make the schools better in general, including making the schools more accessible for handicapped students and features that would prevent more casualties in the case of a school shooter. These would have been fantastic and much needed changes, but unfortunately a majority of voters in Glen Cove opposed the bond but hopefully as time progresses and the school continues to push for it, the high school will get the renovations it needs.', ""In the past four years, I had a pretty good time at Glen Cove High School. I liked most of my teachers, and I enjoyed the diversity at the school. My little sister is going to be at GCHS in a year, and I would really like to see some improvements. The facilities -- mainly science labs -- definitely need to be updated and improved. I think the academics and curriculum also need work. The classes need improvement; some classes didn't effectively prepare me for the end of the year regents or AP exams. The overall school culture needs to change, too. The schools looks so drab, and some liveliness and color could be added to boost students' atmosphere. Also, the graduation rate and vaping problems need to be fixed. I think gym class Sshould be  better run, and more like other schools' gym classes."", ""Glen Cove High School is something I will never forget in my life. It's has matured me and made me a better person now. I love how you could talk to certain teacher's about problems outside or even inside of school and not get criticized; they would find ways to comfort you or give you advice. The teachers try to connect with us to make us enjoy school and class. I love how each year that add new extracurricular activates or clubs. I also heard next year they are going to do 9 periods again which is amazing for students who want extra classes or the kids who don't have lunch periods could now have lunch next year. What I don't enjoy is the school lunch and some of the prices for snack but hopefully they change it soon.

This provides students with the opportunity to help each other. In the future I would like to see the way teachers speak to students change.

Security is good and they are very nice people.  The school has many clubs and sports to get involved in."", ""Glen Cove High School is a very diverse and welcoming school. The staff is amazing here, the teachers, principals, and security are very invested in the students safety and happiness. Every staff member in the school that I know is very determined to create a relationship with the students. From my freshman year to now, I have became so comfortable in the school, and the staff has definitely helped me with that. I have also became very involved in the school's extra curricular activities. I am in clubs and sports, and they have helped me make friendships that have lasted all throughout high school. Glen Cove High School isn't the nicest school, but the GCHS community is something you cant find anywhere else."", 'High School here I had a good time because i surrounded my self with good people and it was easy to get close with teachers and they helped me with a lot.', 'Glen Cove High School is actually quite enjoyable. Their teachers are actually quite good and often seem to go above and beyond for the students.', 'One of Glen Cove High School’s biggest issues is building safety. This year the auditorium stage lights (which were supposed to be secure) fell and nearly rushed students practicing for the school play. The library’s ceiling tiles collapsed and a light in the gym fell and started a fire, and the gym had to be renovated. The list goes on and on. Hopefully the school budget will be passed with much needed renovations soon.Despite all of this GCHS is still a great school in a variety of ways. Most of our teachers are very passionate about their jobs, especially our music teachers. Our select chorale is one of the best in New York. My favorite part of the high school is our unique TV Studio that other schools in the surrounding area lack. Students record and report for “GCTV Friday Morning News” and learn how to edit and create videos. The school is very supportive, diverse and inclusive to students of every background.', 'Overall, my experience at Glen Cove High School has been great. There are a diverse amount of clubs that are open to the students and I wish I had been able to join more. The teachers are great and make time for students to ensure we understand material and achieve the highest grade possible. The administrators care a great deal about us students, our opinions, and showing school pride anyway possible. In my senior year a bond was proposed to make various renovations in all the Glen Cove school districts to create a safer environment and make the schools better in general, including making the schools more accessible for handicapped students and features that would prevent more casualties in the case of a school shooter. These would have been fantastic and much needed changes, but unfortunately a majority of voters in Glen Cove opposed the bond but hopefully as time progresses and the school continues to push for it, the high school will get the renovations it needs.', ""In the past four years, I had a pretty good time at Glen Cove High School. I liked most of my teachers, and I enjoyed the diversity at the school. My little sister is going to be at GCHS in a year, and I would really like to see some improvements. The facilities -- mainly science labs -- definitely need to be updated and improved. I think the academics and curriculum also need work. The classes need improvement; some classes didn't effectively prepare me for the end of the year regents or AP exams. The overall school culture needs to change, too. The schools looks so drab, and some liveliness and color could be added to boost students' atmosphere. Also, the graduation rate and vaping problems need to be fixed. I think gym class Sshould be  better run, and more like other schools' gym classes."", ""Glen Cove High School is something I will never forget in my life. It's has matured me and made me a better person now. I love how you could talk to certain teacher's about problems outside or even inside of school and not get criticized; they would find ways to comfort you or give you advice. The teachers try to connect with us to make us enjoy school and class. I love how each year that add new extracurricular activates or clubs. I also heard next year they are going to do 9 periods again which is amazing for students who want extra classes or the kids who don't have lunch periods could now have lunch next year. What I don't enjoy is the school lunch and some of the prices for snack but hopefully they change it soon. Overall Glen Cove High School is amazing and I'll miss it."", 'I love the ability to have freedom and have a glimpse of what the real world has to offer. This district has taught me responsibility and how to be independent. I love being involved in many clubs, sports, and extra curricular activities.

There are so many different clubs and after school activities that fit everyone's needs and wants. Even if there is not a club you can like its so easy to create one. The school is always open for ideas. We have a very family like environment. Everyone knows everyone and is never afraid to give a wave and a smile. I have loved growing up here in the Glen Cove School District. It has allowed me to meet so many amazing people including students, teachers and coaches. I am very sad that my time here is coming to an end."", 'Out of all the things Glen Cove High School has to offer, what I like most is the diversity. I feel that being a diverse school is very important. It brings different backgrounds, different cultures, and different stories to the table.', ""I like the Glen Cove High School, the teachers are good and you see how much passion they have when teaching their students. They do give good advice too, as teachers they understand the struggle that us as teenagers have and try to relate with us so that we can feel comfortable with how were handling our emotions.

I like this because our world is diverse. The diversity allows for students to get to know there cultures and environments. There is also a poverty level in Glen Cove which exposes to a real world problem early on, including a homeless population and a students living below the poverty line. This provides students with the opportunity to help each other. In the future I would like to see the way teachers speak to students change. Due to the lack of parental involvement there is sometimes a line that is crossed between both teachers and students. This creates an unhealthy environment for all. Although there is a strong administration it is difficult to keep up.', 'Generally happy with my experience at Glen Cove High School.

The teachers know a lot about what they're teaching and they care a lot about their students, and I think that's the most important.  The school also offers a lot of extracurricular and elective choices for the students and opportunities to try and create different ones.  The school isn't too big but also isn't very small.  There aren't many fights, if any at all, and the students here all help each other and stand up for each other."", ""I personally liked how diverse the school was and how many opportunities we had to prepare ourselves for college. I had fun learning and spending time with all the people I met, including the teachers who basically become your best friends to the point that they will let you hangout with them in their classrooms during lunch. However, the school is crowded and understaffed so teachers have to teach multiple grades as well as classes. Also, we share a building with 5 other high schools and 1 middle school so we are constantly interrupted by students from Fordham Leadership. Because of this, our lunch period is at 10 am, so most of us don't eat lunch, but we are allowed to snack during class as long as we clean up after ourselves."", 'I love Kappa international high school. All the teachers are very supportive especially the math teachers. The teachers take their time to actually understand your learning style and give you that extra support. When you need to make up work or need extra help they will stay extra hours for you after school. The teachers have office hours. The afterschool programs are also amazing! Kappa has many sections. We have Catrock which is an outstanding program for anybody who likes to go on adventures and learn new things. We also have JROTC, which I personally enjoy. Then, we have a track, volleyball. baseball, cheerleading, soccer was added this year, robotics, CUP program, student government, etc. Kappa is such a wonderful place with nice options.

We offer International Baccalaureate courses like Biology, Literature, French,  Spanish, Theater and  Math. There is a variety of sports. There is diversity because it is an international school.

They're many trips that occur throughout the year because it is believed that students learn better in the classroom and outside. Trips allow students the chance to come out of there comfort zone and exploring new things. Students are able to engage with other people that they normally wouldn't talk to.

In the way way future, even if my children get into some prestigious high school, I will send them here.', 'The thing I like about HSPS is that they help you get a head start for the future specifically providing information about the college of your choice and how it works, what it requires from you, and what it provides you to better your future.', 'They prepare you for real life. Also, they put you in programs that looks great on your resume. Freshman year, it was sort of overwhelming. As time went on, I began to understand the way that this school is. Coming in as a ninth grader, I thought why do they give so much work. Now I am a senior and I realize that all that hard work really paid off. They give us mastery work. It’s like major projects. When we put that we have completed so many major projects on our resume, jobs would want us even more. It Makes is stand out.

The teachers are absolutely wonderful, they are not just educators but also your close friends that you can talk to about everything. On the other hand our school needs funding that way we can get access to all the necessary things we need to succeed. For example, students on the sports team have to pay for their sport uniforms. This shouldn't be so. We should have access to the necessary things we need without having to pay for them. It's a public school education for a reason. We are obliviously at the school because we can not afford private schools, so asking us to pay for things like this when it should be funded by the government is not right."", 'I enjoyed my 3 years at HSPS as im enjoying my senior year. The teachers are good at their jobs and the chance to join clubs and activities are great. You also connect with the community through numerous opprtunities for community service. Programs like BuildOn, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, etc speak to the bame that public service stands for. The biggest complaint is the spacing of the school. With three other schools in Wingate Campus, the High School for Public Service is confined to one hallway and a few rooms upstairs that creates crowding at times.

Throughout high school, we get taken out of classes to learn more about college and different resources that are readily available for us at the times we need them, In addition to that, our national honor society has morning tutoring for anyone who thinks they need help. And if a student believes they need help, they can talk to their guidance counselor and their counselor will arrange for a student to come in and help them in that subject. Teachers also make time for you as long as you ask. They are available before school and after school to help students. Although our school is not fully equip ed with the newest technology we do have computer labs and a library where the librarian is always there to help. She has the most updated books and also has the computer updated with technology as well. In the classrooms, we have one computer which is used regularly. Notes and books are still used, but it depends on the teacher and the class. Each class set up is different. It just depends on the teacher.', ""In middle school, I was that shy girl.

Even though many of them graduated any minute we find we will be with each other. In addition, I have had some of the best teachers who taught me that its okay to ask questions and come for help. It doesn't hurt you it really helps you. I was apart of two teams and felt welcome readily. I would defiantly chose to go here again."", 'My school is in a very small area. Many of us have gone to school with each other since we were all very little. The academy and the high school in general tries hard to help each other in every little way possible. Their is absolutely no ethnicity or racial boundary. Everyone gets along with each other. Their are the typical high school popular kids groups but most of the time if you leave them alone they leave you alone. In our school, sexual orientation is not an issue either. Our school has a peace alliance group where bisexuals, gays, and lesbians raise awareness and get through the challenges many of them go through. In addition, we have a peer group that helps lower grades through their classes to better succeed as well. Our school is based prominently on helping each other rather than fighting.

I wouldn't wake up and think about going to school. School was where I wanted to be everyday. As we got older, our school rating began to decline and they had to call in Democracy Prep to help the school not be in jeopardy of shutting down. Since then, school has been very hard to keep up with.

However, the school does provide students with certain privileges and rewards for their hard work: international trips, award ceremonies, and local trips.', 'As a senior in Bronx Preparatory Charter School, the teachers are a lot more helpful due to the college admission process. They are very hard on us to apply to FAFSA and common app and just making sure we do everything possible to make this process a whole lot easier. We have an amazing college readiness team who reassures you that you will make it into college regardless of grades, behavior, etc.', 'Bronx prep or Bphs or the famous nickname Bp is not a bad school at first when I walked in I thought the school was horrible and I not going to be  feeling the school but the more I kept going to school the more I grew to like it. Is like everyday I end up being in that school. The people in the school make up the good parts about it. It’s like a family. You walk in and it’s like you get  recognized people wouldn’t forget who you are cause each of everyone of us in that school have an impact on each other. The school is also the “plug “ which I would say we start college readiness the day we enter the build freshman year. I been put on to so many programs well I have attended the school.

Also you feel like a community, in this school and everyone literally knows each other. Food is not as bad, its regular food. It has a great library with lots of interesting books.', 'My school is located in the middle of the south Bronx, an area enriched with violence and poverty. A lot of our students derive from low income families, and depend on the faculty and staff to help provide us with the motivation we need in order to graduate. Our school is big on implementing the idea that the youth hold the biggest voice as a group, and create a voice that has the most power to cause change. It is also big on motivating the students to believe that college is not something that is out of our reach. Being apart of Bronx Prep is truly an experience I could never regret. The relationships I\'ve built with my classmates and even my teachers are un-breakable. The emotional connections you build with everyone around you are genuine and delightful. ""BP love"" could never be replaced. We work together to see not only ourselves, but others succeed.  I can truly say that if it weren\'t for Bronx Prep\'s empowering environment and staff, my mindset would not be how it is currently.', 'What I, in my opinion, like about Bronx Prep Charter High School is its willingness to stay after office hours and make the extra effort to help its students with tasks and intense homework content. I would rate the college readiness at this school a 9 out of 10 because the college counselors actually go the extra mile and help the students decide which college would be the best fit for them, along with answering their questions and confronting their doubts about life after High School. However, something I think the school overall should work on is allowing for more extra advanced placement classes to be formed such as AP Physics and other challenging classes. That way more options would be available to the students.', 'This Is A College Readiness School. It Gives us  work as if we are in college right now. They Even teach us Korean. Instead of Spanish or French like other schools, it’s exclusive. This school is strict and really hard on the students so that we succeed in life.', 'Bronx Prep is a school that I have mixed feelings about. I am extremely grateful for all the opportunities they have provided with my college readiness class, that helped me apply for college and applying for financial aid. They also have the Carrera program here that helps students apply for scholarships and jobs in summer youth. The teachers push the students to their limits here with lengthy assignments and difficult curriculum. There is one side of me that is thankful that I have grown accustomed to difficulty, and another that dislikes the school for the massive workload they don\'t hesitate to give us. The only thing negative I can say about the school is that the environment is not the best, however it is not really the fault of the school since it is mainly the students that make it this way. The school has no control over how students behave, and threatening them with detentions or its ""Deductions"" system is not very beneficial.', ""The school goes above and beyond by taking their students on international trips to the other side of the world and helps students succeed as far as helping them applying and getting accepted into college.

Other highlights of the school are: Korean Language studies, Softball and Basketball teams, Carrera program, and various clubs."", 'Bronx Preparatory Charter School is a very challenging school and the main motive is to get their students ready for college. I think that the safety of the school is very excellent and well organized, however, I feel like the clubs in the school lacks.  They are barely any clubs and I would like that to improve because the students work very hard and stress would ease if clubs were involved.', 'I loved Bronx Preparatory Charter School is not something you would hear often as students struggle with coursework and homework. Bronx Prep has benefited me so much and with the help of the amazing teachers and the high level of preparation offered I know I can accomplish anything.', ""Since I first entered the school back when we used to have a 5th grade, school used to be so fun. I wouldn't wake up and think about going to school. School was where I wanted to be everyday. As we got older, our school rating began to decline and they had to call in Democracy Prep to help the school not be in jeopardy of shutting down. Since then, school has been very hard to keep up with. Many students are doing better, however we are supposed to fit standards that are not realistic for every student, thus making it difficult for many of the students to do well in school."", 'The school has a very rigorous curriculum for students and the high expectations have proven to be too much at times. However, the school does provide students with certain privileges and rewards for their hard work: international trips, award ceremonies, and local trips.', 'As a senior in Bronx Preparatory Charter School, the teachers are a lot more helpful due to the college admission process. They are very hard on us to apply to FAFSA and common app and just making sure we do everything possible to make this process a whole lot easier. We have an amazing college readiness team who reassures you that you will make it into college regardless of grades, behavior, etc.', 'Bronx prep or Bphs or the famous nickname Bp is not a bad school at first when I walked in I thought the school was horrible and I not going to be  feeling the school but the more I kept going to school the more I grew to like it. Is like everyday I end up being in that school. The people in the school make up the good parts about it. It’s like a family. You walk in and it’s like you get  recognized people wouldn’t forget who you are cause each of everyone of us in that school have an impact on each other. The school is also the “plug “ which I would say we start college readiness the day we enter the build freshman year. I been put on to so many programs well I have attended the school.  And I love the school spirit it’s also that helps us connect with each other. We are like a family.', ""Well I'm an old student but, being at BP was an extremely great experience. We got many opportunities to speak to representatives from college, they had good art programs and the teachers and staff were great. They made sure that you got the help you needed no matter what they had to do."", 'The teachers and faculty were really supportive and some were even willing to host study sessions afterschool or on the weekend.', ""I loved the atmosphere and constant push towards academic prosperity. I've been there since 5th grade and I am now a graduating senior, the environment in which that school has turned into has become extremely strict but at the end of the day its for the better,  and the students will appreciate it."", 'I like how they get us prepared for college and the environment is very welcoming and nice. Bronx prep teaches us how to be responsible adults with priorities and goals. The teachers make sure that every student is represented equally and they make sure that we all understand our work. They prepared us for the Sat by getting us A list prep, we also get a lot of prep for the regents. We have a good culture at bronx prep because everyone is connected and it is a very friendly environment. Students are bright here and love learning', ""What I like about my Bronx Prep is that once you step into Senior year they help you apply to colleges and start the process. Once everything is done they make a big celebration and it's the most exciting part you can experience."", 'My experience at Bronx Prep Charter School was pretty cool. The teachers were very friendly to the students at the school. There is good one on one help for the  students that need help. School has lots of supplies. Also you feel like a community, in this school and everyone literally knows each other. Food is not as bad, its regular food. It has a great library with lots of interesting books.', 'My school is located in the middle of the south Bronx, an area enriched with violence and poverty. A lot of our students derive from low income families, and depend on the faculty and staff to help provide us with the motivation we need in order to graduate. Our school is big on implementing the idea that the youth hold the biggest voice as a group, and create a voice that has the most power to cause change. It is also big on motivating the students to believe that college is not something that is out of our reach. Being apart of Bronx Prep is truly an experience I could never regret. The relationships I\'ve built with my classmates and even my teachers are un-breakable. The emotional connections you build with everyone around you are genuine and delightful. ""BP love"" could never be replaced. We work together to see not only ourselves, but others succeed.  I can truly say that if it weren\'t for Bronx Prep\'s empowering environment and staff, my mindset would not be how it is currently.', 'What I, in my opinion, like about Bronx Prep Charter High School is its willingness to stay after office hours and make the extra effort to help its students with tasks and intense homework content. I would rate the college readiness at this school a 9 out of 10 because the college counselors actually go the extra mile and help the students decide which college would be the best fit for them, along with answering their questions and confronting their doubts about life after High School. However, something I think the school overall should work on is allowing for more extra advanced placement classes to be formed such as AP Physics and other challenging classes. That way more options would be available to the students.', 'This Is A College Readiness School. It Gives us  work as if we are in college right now. They Even teach us Korean. Instead of Spanish or French like other schools, it’s exclusive. This school is strict and really hard on the students so that we succeed in life.', 'Bronx Prep is a school that I have mixed feelings about. I am extremely grateful for all the opportunities they have provided with my college readiness class, that helped me apply for college and applying for financial aid. They also have the Carrera program here that helps students apply for scholarships and jobs in summer youth. The teachers push the students to their limits here with lengthy assignments and difficult curriculum. There is one side of me that is thankful that I have grown accustomed to difficulty, and another that dislikes the school for the massive workload they don\'t hesitate to give us. The only thing negative I can say about the school is that the environment is not the best, however it is not really the fault of the school since it is mainly the students that make it this way. The school has no control over how students behave, and threatening them with detentions or its ""Deductions"" system is not very beneficial.', ""The school goes above and beyond by taking their students on international trips to the other side of the world and helps students succeed as far as helping them applying and getting accepted into college. I just hoped that they weren't so strict as to their dress code.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""I was a transfer student who at first was upset because I did not want to leave my other high school.

It helped me be diligent, and helped me focus on my work. I've flourished and prospered because of the school I came from, and I love it!"", 'What I liked about the Information Technology Interdistrict Multi-Magnet School is that it has a big variety of classes that us students can take, including multiple of the ECE courses. We also have great teachers who take their time to help us out with what we need help on and help us out with things outside of that classroom.', 'This school offers a lot of things. There are so many clubs and extracuriculars that you can always find what you want. There are so many options in you respective field if study. In the IT school you can study technology from taking robotics, to practicing media production, to programming! We have so much oppourtunity to explore that we even offer classes from the other schools if you wanna experience other fields unrelated to your school. The one and only thing I would change is the non existance of sports. We have no sports here so we miss out on a lot of highschool experiences. We dont have homecomings or sporting games/events and I sometimes envy other schools. What we dont offer in sports we offer in academic teams like cyber surcurity but not too many students get to crazy about those things.', 'My experience at the Information Technology school at Fairchild Wheeler Interdistrict Magnet High School, was interesting. I made a lot of good friends the three years I have been there. I learned a lot about technology and computer software that it landed me a job at the IT department at my college.', ""It is a very welcoming school and it provides us with a clean and safe environment. There are plenty of things to learn and here we have okay lunch and the classes are like a college and we go by semesters which isn't bad. The school is big and there are good teachers."", ""What I like about Fairchild wheeler is that is really different academically to the other schools in Bridgeport. They have it set up so the students can really be engaged and creative in their classes. Unfortunately what I would like to see change in Fairchild is some of the teachers attitudes towards the students you can tell the teachers who really care and the ones that just want their money's worth."", 'I have attended Fairchild Wheeler for my four years of High School. The curriculum can be challenging but, rewarding. I was exposed to many topics about engineering that I would not have been exposed to in other schools.', ""I absolutely love how hands-on the classes are! Teachers are constantly changing their delivery of the content to keep up with the current technology. They also always have the students' interest in mind when constructing their lessons. This school has always valued and praised students who are reach and go above the expectations. The only thing to say would be that"", ""I overall like Fairchild wheeler. You are able to chose a field you are interested in and experience it before the college process to see whether you like it or not. The school has alot of resources but not all students have access to them. Junior year is when you start getting permission to take specialty course classes. The first two years are like any other school. Fairchild does not have any sports or and real sense of school spirit. There is no attachment or pride that comes with attendance. However it is a very diverse campus with a healthy variety of people. Teachers at Fairchild are relatively young. This makes classes exciting and it's easy to relate with the teachers. Unfortunately cost of living in Connecticut is high and bridgeport edu salaries are low so most of the teachers leave after 1 - 2 years of teaching."", ""My experience was really bad in the beginning. This of course was because the resources provided to other Connecticut district schools were not set in place for a newly built school. The library wasn't available, the gym wasn't being used, along with academic advising and students having to take buses after school to play sports for other established high schools in the area. As an incoming freshman my high school experience wasn't that good yet as the years progressed the academic advising and resources became more available for the incoming freshman. Honestly, the academic strength of this school was very well pushed and the strive to be challenged was thrilling. I appreciate the effort many teachers made to push the students along with myself, to seek help and adjust to challenging elective based school."", 'The teachers were pretty good and so were the classes themselves. My classmates were good people, but the administration behind the school needs to be worked on', 'This School is very good. This campus prepares students for the whole college experience by introducing challenging courses from the start of high school.', ""This is probably one of the best High School campuses I have/will ever see. However, in terms of the specialized classes that the school promises, I was disappointed. Most of those classes are taught by teachers who are not familiar with that field, thus providing somewhat shoddy day-to-day lessons. They explain that the classes are geared more towards self-motivated exploration, but that provides little reason to ever be in the classroom.General classes tend to be much better; this school has a plethora of kind and bubbly teachers who all try their best to eke out the best you, not just in terms of their classwork. Some teachers may be harder on you than others, but it is always in their students' best interests. The school has a gargantuan amount of resources and most aren't really made aware to students. However, if you go search for help, almost everything you could ask for as a student is there for you."", 'An excellent school that provides rigorous coursework. The academic drive is mainly focused on stem subjects. The building is beautiful and teachers very dedicated. This school has made me a better person.', 'It is fine but there should be less focus on dress code and more on academics. The teachers are fine and there is a ton of diversity. The school is also very safe thanks to the security guards and metal detectors.', 'It is a fine school I had a great experience with the teachers who all helped me with my grades and preparing for college.', ""I loved attending Fairchild, obviously there are some things that need to be changed. However, it is still a new school and some things just haven't fallen into place yet. I believe that this is a great school for those that take the opportunity's they are given."", 'The Information Technology & Software Engineering at the Fairchild Wheeler Campus was a great school. It provided me with ample opportunities to take courses for college credit, in order to lower the workload in college. Given that this was my primary focus in High School, it\'s easy to see why I would like the school as much as I did. As with everything, however, there are drawbacks. ""Normal"" level courses are incredibly easy, as there is such a diverse crowd of students coming from all different towns in the state. This creates an almost immediate imbalance of learning, where the students who already passed the learning cirriclium in their prior schools were expected to wait until others caught up.', 'The campus has a lot of good technology. Teachers are great and work well with the students. There are a lot of good opportunities to get college credits and be prepared for college.', 'At Fairchild Wheeler, I had an average experience during my 4 years of attendance. Although I benefitted from the academics, I always felt that I could learn more from the faculty. I felt that our school lacked in culture and team spirit due to the fact that we did not participate in athletics or sporting events. Even though our NHS team would host events throughout the school year, I  never felt that our school had a community within. hope to see more events in NHS or sports involvement within our school in the future.

Origins High School,"[""I've spent all four years of my high school experience at Origins and to sum it up it's been great. Right from the start, it's a very welcoming place and that's from both the students and teachers. It's a very diverse environment that I've learned a lot about different cultures. The only thing I would complain about is like two of the teachers but other than them all the teachers there are amazing people."", ""My experience here will be a part of me for the rest of my life, I've been through and seen a lot. What I like about being here is that most of the time if you need help, want to see something change, or want to propose an idea the resources are always there, and the schools always improving. What I'd like to see change is rules of the school when it comes to students, and their own technology."", 'I’ve been at OHS for 2 years, and I’ll be graduating this year. My time at OHS has been great. The school environment is amazing. They have very good teachers which never get tired of helping you with your work. The Diversity is stupendous. My classmates were from different parts of the world and I got to learn a little bit about their culture. During my school years at OHS, I was in many extracurricular activities. Such as the Music Club, Soccer Team, National Honor Society. This just shows how much diversity there is in the clubs and activities as well. There are many clubs you can choose from. There’s even a SPACE Club. My time at OHS has just been exceptional.', ""Origins High School isn't a very good school. The people around the school make the school a better place but the school could be better."", 'What I love most about the school is the teachers. You can tell that they really care for the students and want to see them succeed. However, some things that definitely need to be improved is the cleanliness of he bathrooms, school lunch, and student involvement in clubs.', 'My overall experience in Origins High School was very satisfying. I always received assistance with everything I asked for. Furthermore, the teachers and the staff were very approachable and prioritized the students.', 'Origins High School is a great school for students of different personalities, backgrounds, and habits. Being a student that was very outgoing yet lacking some motivation for my education, the school definitely taught me that if I work for what I want, nothing should hamper me from acquiring it.', 'I really appreciate how devoted to the students success each of the teachers were. I was also able to be myself and engage in activities that were aligned with my interests.', ""I felt Origins High School was a bittersweet school. Some of the staff was very kind and understanding and some weren't welcoming at all. I felt thenschool treated us like kids and didn't allow student who have met all criteria to leave school early. The security guards are very disrespectful and are not welcoming to the students. the teachers have good lesson plans. They need to improve and the friendliness and attitude of the staff."", 'The school is a small new school and is still growing. The school is sharing the campus with other three schools. Things are changing every year in order to create a better environment for students. The college readiness is great yet can still be improved.', 'I love this school. I am new at this school and I love the way the teachers are, the studies, the staff. overall everything', 'My experience of this high school was really good. The school offers very challenging courses that help students learn how college life will be like. They help us prepare for future job interviews and also helping us apply for colleges.  Even if the school food is not that good, they offer an out to lunch pass for students with 3.0 GPA or higher which is really good.', 'Unfortunately, there weren\'t many challenging classes. There are only two ""AP"" classes, AP Literature seems more legit than AP Lang, which doesn\'t offer challenging workload, just a bonus after. Plus, some AP students were placed with Sp\'ed kids, which are careless and disruptive to those who want to learn. Additionally, while bringing this up to the principle, he called the students ""whiners and complainers"". The principle likes to shut down the ambitious  students suggestions and ignore them and only cares about the kids who don\'t care. Phones are not allowed in the school even though the NYC DOE allowed them for all the schools, phones are to be collected after school. On the positive note, all the teachers are young and ambitious and actually do care for the students. As said this school won\'t prepare kids for college, you have to be motivated and surrounded by good people, and the teachers will also motivate you.', ""My experience is origins was pretty great. A first in frshaman year it was a bit scary since I was new to it all but, the school was really welcoming. Origins high school is like my second home now because it lets me be who I really am and act like who I am. At home I'm a box I can't really stretch out and do what I want, but when at school I get to be free and be me. Origins let me expand my thinking and made me academically smart.

The school nurse in the HS gives ea. student a bandaid for all issues & sends them on their way ususally. Health programs and resources are usually directed to the middle and elementary school, because the older kids can voice their concerns to their parents & their private family insurance programs. Over the 2015 summer break, the Board of Ed found it necessary to install security cameras in all hallway points and public areas, to try to get a hand on drug and other safety issues in the school. All Wood-Ridge District schools have HIBA policies in place, but the teaching staff and administration have not always previously followed through on some things. I know of one special needs child, was not identified and the parents directed accordingly, which in turn was then labeled as a behavioral issue. That kid was bullied by peers, teachers & administration, and then he reacted badly. His mother was bullied by the administration and has since resulted in the parents having to pay beyond their means to place him in another private school, where he would be protected and accomodated better. It was reported that he is doing better, flourishing and getting splendid grades now, compared to here at Wood-Ridge. I am happy now that Wood-Ridge is joining SPAN, where our younger student families will be able to be helped as necessary going forward. We also now have the Wood-Ridge Public Education Foundation to help in areas where the Board of Ed and the PTA are lacking. On numerous occasions over the years, teachers had difficulties teaching for lack of funding for appropriate work and/or text books for each student, because grants were found and funneled to our football and cheerleader sports instead.  The foundation has publicly reported that just over its first 3 years of existence, 53,000 dollars have been raised to support teachers' and students' educational needs in our high, middle, & elementary schools."", ""Outwardly, a very friendly town, but cliquish. Student social culture is stilted due to clicks and social group biases. A majority of of the current seniors are the last vestiges of decent, respectful, behaved and decent speaking young people in our school. Each subsequent generation is worse than the one before. Even the teachers will tell you that and it is reflected in their interactions with the students. The fault lies with the parents, either non-involvement or nepotistic manner in most activities or sports. Generally though, we do have many caring members of the community and it's usually the same people you always see, leading to bring betterment for our students all around. If not for financial reasons and hesitation of taking the kids away from their friends, we would move, but what place is better. Also, if the students who are our shining stars in our small town were recognized, by sports organizations, sports programs and colleges and the media, on the same division levels and academically as other schools in NJ, maybe community spirit would be different. I also blame the economy on distracting inept parents from their responsibilities of supporting their students and schools. \r On a positive note...Since the STEM initiative, our district has been working to develop a STEM program here in all our schools. Three years ago, a select group of parents started the Wood Ridge Public Education Foundation to support and enhance our school district, with no hindrance by the Board of Education and Parent Teachers Association who have missed things. Also, concerned parents started working in 2015 to bring SPAN, the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network, to our district to help families with special needs. With more parental involvement,  more work, and time, Wood-Ridge will be a place to live and raise shining scholars and future leaders, that it once was in years and generations past."", 'It is not a school focused on technology at 100%, but it gives students the necessary support in all areas according to require it.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['The staff at ""WRJRSRHS"" does not care about your success.

The school nurse in the HS gives ea. student a bandaid for all issues & sends them on their way ususally. Health programs and resources are usually directed to the middle and elementary school, because the older kids can voice their concerns to their parents & their private family insurance programs. Over the 2015 summer break, the Board of Ed found it necessary to install security cameras in all hallway points and public areas, to try to get a hand on drug and other safety issues in the school. All Wood-Ridge District schools have HIBA policies in place, but the teaching staff and administration have not always previously followed through on some things. I know of one special needs child, was not identified and the parents directed accordingly, which in turn was then labeled as a behavioral issue. That kid was bullied by peers, teachers & administration, and then he reacted badly. His mother was bullied by the administration and has since resulted in the parents having to pay beyond their means to place him in another private school, where he would be protected and accomodated better. It was reported that he is doing better, flourishing and getting splendid grades now, compared to here at Wood-Ridge. I am happy now that Wood-Ridge is joining SPAN, where our younger student families will be able to be helped as necessary going forward. We also now have the Wood-Ridge Public Education Foundation to help in areas where the Board of Ed and the PTA are lacking. On numerous occasions over the years, teachers had difficulties teaching for lack of funding for appropriate work and/or text books for each student, because grants were found and funneled to our football and cheerleader sports instead.  The foundation has publicly reported that just over its first 3 years of existence, 53,000 dollars have been raised to support teachers' and students' educational needs in our high, middle, & elementary schools."", ""Outwardly, a very friendly town, but cliquish. Student social culture is stilted due to clicks and social group biases. A majority of of the current seniors are the last vestiges of decent, respectful, behaved and decent speaking young people in our school. Each subsequent generation is worse than the one before. Even the teachers will tell you that and it is reflected in their interactions with the students. The fault lies with the parents, either non-involvement or nepotistic manner in most activities or sports. Generally though, we do have many caring members of the community and it's usually the same people you always see, leading to bring betterment for our students all around. If not for financial reasons and hesitation of taking the kids away from their friends, we would move, but what place is better. Also, if the students who are our shining stars in our small town were recognized, by sports organizations, sports programs and colleges and the media, on the same division levels and academically as other schools in NJ, maybe community spirit would be different. I also blame the economy on distracting inept parents from their responsibilities of supporting their students and schools. \r On a positive note...Since the STEM initiative, our district has been working to develop a STEM program here in all our schools. Three years ago, a select group of parents started the Wood Ridge Public Education Foundation to support and enhance our school district, with no hindrance by the Board of Education and Parent Teachers Association who have missed things. Also, concerned parents started working in 2015 to bring SPAN, the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network, to our district to help families with special needs. With more parental involvement,  more work, and time, Wood-Ridge will be a place to live and raise shining scholars and future leaders, that it once was in years and generations past."", 'It is not a school focused on technology at 100%, but it gives students the necessary support in all areas according to require it.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,

The New Visions Charter High School for the Humanities,"['I lasted for three weeks ""teaching"" Spanish at this school.  Non-native, Heritage, and Native Speakers-many of which had IEP\'s- were all thrown into the same Spanish I class, and most did not know they were taking Spanish until the first day of school.    The administrators had  no teaching experience, as they pretended to engage in ""restorative practices"".   Students\' behavior was deplorable.   The ambitious plan of having three trimesters so kids can earn more credits (up to 20 they say) is a farce.  The third trimester is really a make- up period for failing students.      Administrators genuflect to students instead of disciplining them as they are fearful they  will simply move to a different floor of the old Kennedy High School, which houses 6 or 7 charter schools.  In this school, stroking students is paramount to educating them.', 'It was a great experience. The school had so much to offer so there was so much to do. They gave each child some amazing experiences and opportunities. Overall the school made every child ready for not only college but life after college.', 'The faculty there was extremely helpful - if you make it known that you need help. Once you feel comfortable enough to speak to somebody, it can really make a difference.', 'New visions charter school for the humanities is a really great school. I am as of right now a senior in new visions and I love the school. I love the school because the teachers give 110%  to make sure their students succeed and make it to college.', 'I love how involved the staff are in students academic achievement  and there are numerous activities for a student to part-take in. Teachers are constantly ready to spend extra time outside of class to help with school and outside school related work. I love how comfortable and safe I am when speaking to my teachers, deans and counselors.', ""I like new vision charter school I attended 4 years at this school. The principal is very nice and strict she does not play around that's why I love this school. The teachers are very nice and you can learn from them they teach pretty good they have office hours for kids who need help. The kids are very friendly every one get along with each other that's what good about the school. I am on the Track and Field Team and also on the Volleyball Team. The sports are ok they need some more kids to take it seriously like I do but I am doing great at both sports."", 'New Visions Charter High School for the Humanities is a good school. There may be negative aspects to this school, but I’d like to believe that the positives outweigh the drawbacks. I had lots connections with my teachers and staff, and they were all very helpful in helping me strive to be the best I can be.', 'New Visions Charter High School for the Humanities is a great school, counselors push you forward to take new courses/classes to gain more knowledge. The student faculty ratio is usually 15:1 and they would place office hours if you are in need of help with anything so you wont stay behind with class work.', ""I love the teachers and the academics here. The faculty really do try to do right by the students and give them the best education possible but you need to apply yourself as a student. Many kids don't succeed because they value  social standing more than there grades. If you apply yourself you can really thrive here"", 'This school is amazing when it comes to opportunities and teacher student relationships. The teachers become almost like youre parents, beatfriends. The one thing I dislike is how the school. Treats the students as if they were still in middle school not conditioning us to how college life will be like. They baby us and eventually we become dependent on the constant nagging and ""if you get late to school were taking your phones"" or ""you didn\'t hand it in on time its just minus a small amount of points"" this of course is something we will not get in college. Besides this major flaw I love the school teachers, students and of course the Humanities Kennedy Pride. GO KNIGHTS', 'In this school I feel safe and I like how the school is finding better way to help its  students succeed after they graduate high school. For example, this year they introduced a program where students can graduate high school with some college credits.', ""What I like most about the school is the staff's involvement in the student's lives. The staff cares about whether you pass or fail and you're able to voice your opinion with out consequences."", 'During the years at this high school, theres been ups and downs. I would sometimes find myself in difficult classes but teachers would notice and help me or my counselor would change me to another teacher. Therefore I would say that my experience at this school was okay. Something I would change would  be that i would provide more activities and make the school more fun.', 'We have an excellent teaching staff who truly care about their students. We have tons of opportunities for internships and college credits. The rate in which the students graduate is in the 90s overall a great school.', ""I attended The New Visions Charter High School for Humanities from September 2011 - June 2015. My experience was okay, but it could have been better. When I attended the school the school was not very diverse, the staff was inconsistent, I had a new principal my senior year. It was a uniform school, that aspect wasn't bad and the school day was very long, I am talking about 8am -4:30pm Monday - Friday, but my schedule changed during my senior year. During my senior year had a shorter.  There also wasn't a variety of courses, but the school was college and career-bound. For instance, students were given the opportunity to take college classes on college campuses and students were able to participate in internship opportunities in offices on school grounds, Montefiore hospitals, City officials offices, etc. Those aspects really helped my resume and my college application process.

While I enjoyed my time at Liberty, the school itself was run very strictly and certain policies made it difficult for students to enjoy after school activities and to find places to study after school. Overall the teachers are what really make up the heart of Liberty. They provide guidance and aid whenever needed if you are lucky enough to study with the right ones and really take advantage of all that they have to offer you."", ""What I loved about Jackson Liberty High School the most was the accepting environment. Our principal Ms. Maureen Butler made it her priority to see that every student's sexual orientation, race, religion, etc. were accepted and those who did not were taught the importance of acceptance and kindness. We have so many clubs that embrace the differences of the students. Clubs that include the multicultural club and the Fellow Christian Athletes. Some things I would change about this school would be how it does not properly prepare you for the real world. In this school, everyone's a winner. And sadly the real world, you don't always win. Though it helps with grades and overall GPA, the teachers here are very lenient and “pass” you if they feel you should, meaning they can minipulate your grade to their descretion. This hurts college readiness skills."", 'The principal is highly sexist, and will go as far as to side with female bullies when the victim is male. This is verified not only by the stance she takes, but by the side she chooses to listen to as well. If you’re male, you will be punished before your side of the story is told. It seems she fails to realize that the most common strategy of female bullying against men, is “technical” accusations of “misconduct” regardless of the merit they hold. The easiest being “ I feel threatened”. Keep in mind, a threat does not have to be made, in order for that line to be used, and reciprocated with harsh discipline against the accused. This can make a fairly well behaved young man, feel like a outcasted monster, because his emotions will not be taken seriously. This of course, does not pertain to every circumstance - but it happens often enough for the vice principal to share the same sentiment.Other than that, the other staff are excellent.', 'I liked my high school experience.

I felt that there were many options of courses to choose from, and they prepared me very well for college.  Most of the teachers I had were excellent, but there were also several teachers I had who were horrible.  These teachers openly explained that they hated the class subject and that they were forced to teach it by the principal, and therefore they didn't teach the subjects well at all.  Aside from academics, there were many activities so be involved in.  I liked how Jackson Liberty makes it easy for students to be well-rounded because all of the clubs coordinate to ensure that their meetings aren't at the same time.  We also had  a considerably large amount of school spirit."", 'Great teaching staff and administration.

It was always a friendly atmosphere and the students were friendly too.', 'For the most part, Jlib provided a neutral environment that allowed me to work on my own goals in my own time. Scheduling classes was very easy and they worked around my own schedule. Overall, the academics were amazing, take into account that I have only been taking Honors and AP classes, and I feel like I could happily leave next year with the level of learning that I revieved.', 'My high school experience at Jackson Liberty had abig impact on choosing my college. I wanted to continue my education in a place that felt like home and where people knew each other and liked being together. I especially feel the Adventure Bound course I was able to attend the overnight canoe trip in which I learned alittle more about life and made friendships to last a lifetime.My Guidance counselor at Liberty was key in making my college placement successful. He went above and beyond assisting me with any of my worries. Jackson Liberty has a truly special place in my heart and is place I call home.', 'I hate it here people are mean and rude no one cares for each other the admiration sucks and has no care for the darker and just lie to our faces teachers are kinda racist and it sucks the student of color are targeted for their differences and standing up for themselves', ""Jackson Liberty High School provides various level of coursework for students and has different activities to suit various students' interests. While I enjoyed my time at Liberty, the school itself was run very strictly and certain policies made it difficult for students to enjoy after school activities and to find places to study after school. Overall the teachers are what really make up the heart of Liberty. They provide guidance and aid whenever needed if you are lucky enough to study with the right ones and really take advantage of all that they have to offer you."", ""What I loved about Jackson Liberty High School the most was the accepting environment. Our principal Ms. Maureen Butler made it her priority to see that every student's sexual orientation, race, religion, etc. were accepted and those who did not were taught the importance of acceptance and kindness. We have so many clubs that embrace the differences of the students. Clubs that include the multicultural club and the Fellow Christian Athletes. Some things I would change about this school would be how it does not properly prepare you for the real world. In this school, everyone's a winner. And sadly the real world, you don't always win. Though it helps with grades and overall GPA, the teachers here are very lenient and “pass” you if they feel you should, meaning they can minipulate your grade to their descretion. This hurts college readiness skills."", 'The principal is highly sexist, and will go as far as to side with female bullies when the victim is male. This is verified not only by the stance she takes, but by the side she chooses to listen to as well. If you’re male, you will be punished before your side of the story is told. It seems she fails to realize that the most common strategy of female bullying against men, is “technical” accusations of “misconduct” regardless of the merit they hold. The easiest being “ I feel threatened”. Keep in mind, a threat does not have to be made, in order for that line to be used, and reciprocated with harsh discipline against the accused. This can make a fairly well behaved young man, feel like a outcasted monster, because his emotions will not be taken seriously. This of course, does not pertain to every circumstance - but it happens often enough for the vice principal to share the same sentiment.Other than that, the other staff are excellent.', 'I liked my high school experience. Most teachers there are super cool and are willing to help you. I would start high school over again if I could.', 'I was new to Jackson my freshman year of highschool. I love how welcoming all the teachers and other staff were. I felt at home, not like I was stranded someone out of my comfort zone. The one thing I would say I dislike is the way some parts of the curriculum are set up, I feel I could get way more out of a class if it was 40 minutes all year rather than 80 minutes half the year.', ""I was very fond of the academics at Jackson Liberty.  I felt that there were many options of courses to choose from, and they prepared me very well for college.  Most of the teachers I had were excellent, but there were also several teachers I had who were horrible.  These teachers openly explained that they hated the class subject and that they were forced to teach it by the principal, and therefore they didn't teach the subjects well at all.  Aside from academics, there were many activities so be involved in.  I liked how Jackson Liberty makes it easy for students to be well-rounded because all of the clubs coordinate to ensure that their meetings aren't at the same time.  We also had  a considerably large amount of school spirit."", 'Great teaching staff and administration.  I have learned a great deal through academics as well as being a part of sports teams.', 'At Jackson Liberty High School, I have had an excellent experience. The teachers and staff are very professional and help create an enjoyable and safe educational environment. They help equip students for success in the future.', 'Jackson Liberty High School has offered many opportunities for me, those of which I thought I would never have been involved in.  I know I had to work hard academically from day one but joining the marching band was something not on my list.  I have enjoyed all I have experienced in this band program and Mr. Katona, our band director has been most influential throughout my high school career.  He has given me many memories which will never be forgotten.....Disney Parade, Washington  Memorial Parade and Thanksgiving Day Parade in Philadelphia...just to name a few.   I believed and  have become more confident in myself as a student and as a leader.    I have maintained  a good GPA and can state with confidence that I have set out and achieved many personal and valuable goals for myself to carry on with me throughout my college years.  Looking back I am very happy and grateful with all that I have accomplished.', ""The campus is beautiful and our principal is always trying to make our highschool experience better. The teachers are cool and there's always something fun happening after school."", 'I am very much involve in Liberty.  I participate in several clubs, as well as sports.  Great school spirit, the classes are challenging and prepare me for college.', 'There is so much to do here. Every week we have different after school or even in school activities going on such as Battle of the Classes, Grim Reaper Project, Spirit week, assemblies, etc. You will never go a week being bored.', 'Awesome school....i have had a great experience with my teachers and especially the guidance dept.  My senior guidance counselor has really helped me with my college interests.', ""I like how well-kept the school is, and how pleasant and comforting the teachers are that we as students are able to confide in them without feel intimidated or worried.  However, the students' lack of common sense (not all, but some) and the way the staff may handle those students is not the most appropriate way of doing so, which can cause disgruntled students and parents."", ""Best thing about JLib was that I got to go to Brick vocational school and work closer to my career.

In the 10th grade students will start taking college classes at Queensborough Community College.  Coming out of this school, you'll be able to find a job with great pay and also be college ready.

That's what I really liked about Btech, my voice was always heard."", 'Everything about BTECH is great, my only complaint is that we don’t have our own building, which causes slight problems with the internet connection. Besides that, our lunch could be more diverse, and I’d like to see a more efficient system for clubs and extra curricular activities within the school.', 'Its a decent school that gives students an advantage at starting college early. The good thing about this school is that there are many supportive teachers. You also get to start college at Queensborough Community College in 10th grade. The only bad thing about this school is that it shares campus with Martin Van Buren High School which is a bad school.

Some teachers are amazing, but some feel like they don\'t even try at all. Compared to other schools, this school doesn\'t have enough money to provide for the large population in it, so the technology isn\'t that great, and the food isn\'t really good. The school is very safe compared to other school districts, but this is only the result of administration enforcing rules very strictly.

Our principal Mr. Richard Loeschner was named best principal in the state. Through my high school career he has been more than a principal he has been a lifeline, a bestfriend, a counselor, and a father figure. He knows just about everyone’s name in the school and makes sure his “children” are okay and are getting the right resources and attention they need.

Though it is very crowded it is a nice environment. The teachers are excellent at their jobs and make learning fun by developing good relationships with their students.

If you prefer a small environment Urban is a perfect school for you.', 'Transferring to this school was the best decision of my life. The atmosphere was very homelike and caring.

Our administration spends money on chrome books, programs for the chrome books to see what tabs we have open, and software to access the webcams of the chrome books while we fry in the summer and freeze in the winter. If you can't figure out how to navigate the college process, you're screwed, because our guidance department doesn't know how to or won't help. Many of the teachers don't even like their jobs and more of the good teachers retire every year.

Williamsburg High School for Architecture & Design,"['Personally, my WHSAD experience thus far has been great. It’s a small school community where everyone knows everyone. There’s many opportunities so long as you’re willing to pursue them.', 'What I like about Williamsburg High school For Architecture and Design is the teachers are dedicated to the students in making sure we are striving for greatness throughout our four years here. The school offers us many different internship programs like Ace Mentor ship program where we work at an Architecture firm in Manhattan called Gensler.  The school offers many different clubs and sports we have the opportunity to compete. We have sports like volleyball, track, flag football, bat mitten, we have clubs like Art club, dance, architecture club. The students and teachers are very involved in terms of having school spirits and student teacher activities.', ""Williamburg high school is a mediocre public school that puts no time and effort into developing students into college ready students. the work is so easy that its designed for even a middle schoolers to pass yet somehow they still have students that fail every year. the clubs and activities suck is super low budgeted and the school cant afford to send the students on any trips. honestly don't even waste your time there."", 'I would say that the school is overall a 4.5 since the school offers a lot of opportunities to its students but the school only has one fatal flaw that is bringing it down.  the school offers so much for the students to do but it becomes suffocating. you start helping out at high school fairs then teachers notice you then suddenly they have you working for them and start to fall behind in classes.', 'Williamsburg High School for Architecture and Design is an okay school, but one thing it teaches is Architecture classes, which not many schools have. Its a great way to learn these software and we even get a certificate for finishing an AutoCAD test which is great for our resume and getting into an Architecture major.', ""Williamsburg High School is a decent school. If you are interested in Architecture and Design, you should be fine here. The architecture teachers here are qualified and know what they are teaching. There are plenty of opportunities. Right now, I am currently doing an internship at the Empire State Building. It's not a bad school."", 'The school is great and help to raise money to what the students want to do for their last year come', 'The teachers and students have a good impact on me & compared to my middle school; this school wins.', ""It's an okay school, i felt like there was only stuff that was geared towards certain students and there wasn't much choice. Take for example sports there are only 2 varsity teams for boys, baseball and basketball. Most of the students don't care about their education. If you have a teacher named baldwin run the other way switch your schedule do something he's terrible"", ""I like how the teachers are really there for you and are willing to help you when you struggle.

I wish they offered more classes like anatomy and more ap courses."", 'I like that this school teaches students an architectural field for all four years of your high school tenure. They have many diverse clubs and give opportunities to receive college credits. If you are having trouble with something a teacher will go out their way to help you succeed. The teachers are very caring. The environment is just great.', 'Its a great college for those that want to pursue a architecture career for their future.

Students can pretty much get disciplined for just about anything. The bench was a form of discipline when students didn't follow the classroom and school wide rules. The bench is when a student misbehaves and is isolated from the rest of the student population. Students can be on the bench from 1 day to many many days depending on their circumstance. During this time student would wear a yellow jersey that would stand out to let other students know that they are in trouble and cant be spoken to. During lunch there is a designated table for people on the bench and not only that for the duration of the bench time students have to attend detention every day after school for up to an hour. Students also owe a letter to the detention teacher if they still misbehaved during the day while they were on the bench. Now the number of letter depended on what the student did and how often they did it. Regardless if the student misbehaved or not they still owe a letter at the end of the detention. The letter was to ones self explaining what they did and why, apologizing, and assuring that it wont happen again. To top things off a person cannot get off the bench unless all of their letters are handed in. I've seen many students be benched and get into trouble during their time. Despite that one good day that would determine whether or not the student getting off of the bench it wouldn't matter because their letter isn't handed in. I've seen students benched months at a time because they just didn't know how to act. I've seen students have to write a total of 50 letters just for them to be released from the bench, and even then they still were continuously benched because they just didn't know how to act. Overall discipline is present and the school is the best at making sure students are accountable for their actions."", 'Teachers at TEAM always went above and beyond for their students.

All the teachers have such high expectations for students, and expect so much from us. We were given, and were able to experience many opportunities, that for I myself can say I never knew who would experience. I wouldn't choose this school again if I could do it over because I did everything I had to do when I was there.

The teachers are active and energetic, classmates are participating, and the environment is also supportive. If I were to change something, it'd most certainly be the college readiness. This school does indeed give challenging classes and hard courses, but as far as getting me ready for college, I'm not sure. Such as SATs and standardized tests, you are on your own. I would highly recommend this school for your child though. Amazing experience!"", 'WOW, this school is wonderful! The teachers & counselors are amazing, they truly help you & care for you!', ""So far, it has been amazing, couldn't ask for a better school to go to! The teachers love teaching and they have more clubs than I can count! Also, the diversity is just one of the best things about this school, I walk down the halls seeing various student from different backgrounds, I LOVE IT HERE!"", ""It's litty in all aspects!! There are teachers at CHS that you wouldn't be able to find any where else. They make you look forward to their class everyday because of how enjoyable and fulfilling it it. Our school diversity is something to behold. Since we are such a large school, the sheer differences in cultures and ethnic backgrounds would be very enlightening to any student who attends CHS. (just to name a few...)"", ""I've had many ups and downs during my 4 years at Clifton High but I can say that the teachers and my peers have helped me go through the good and the bad.

I learned both academic and real-world information to guide my future endeavors.', 'One pro that I would like to mention is that the school offers freedom for it\'s students, making the term ""the high school that feels like a college"", more believable. This pro can also be a con sometimes, giving if the student isn\'t mature enough to handle these college related freedoms regrading academics, and they fail to earn the expected number of credits, then they\'ll be transferred to a credit recovery school. This hardly happens since the teachers here are one of best I\'ve encountered since my first year in middle school. The school setting can make you lazy when it comes to academics, making a simple essay seem like a 12 page report. Besides that, the work load is pretty manageable, and the classes aren\'t hard to pass. If you\'re an athlete I wouldn\'t recommend you to attend this school, the teams aren\'t that good.

The teachers  and consulars are people who understand that we as teenagers will have problems and they help us figure out what we can do to solve it and how to both be a good student and also solve our own personal problems. The school is safe and there isn't much fighting in the area, all students respect each other and the teachers. It is with that respect we learn through them. As I got older I realize that the teacher we hated or dislike help us grow as an person, because of that I am very grateful for the help they give us. The consulars that talk to us and ask us how we are feeling can help us."", ""I'll make this short and sweet. UHeights is a gem of the South Bronx. It isn't the best school nor the worst, but each year my school continually strives to provide more than adequate education. In the Bronx, success for children may seem like a dream for the average minority student, but my school convinced me that I am more than just the color of my skin. At University Heights I was shown that in a sea of predominantly white colleges, I am just as, smart, talented, and skilled to succeed. One of its unique features is the number of programs that we have. I was able to travel abroad in my sophomore year because of the surplus of programs I partook in. Simply put, I old have wanted to spend my high school career anywhere else."", 'Unfortunately, my issues with this school comes from the many restrictions placed on students. Students are not allowed to wear the color red. As well that students are not even allowed to wear the sweater of their choice. They are only allowed to wear University Heights branded sweaters. Some students spend day and night in the school and should have the right to wear comfortable clothing, and express themselves.', ""Overall this school is a very good school. We have a lot of activities and great teachers that came from Ivy League institutions giving students help they need. Most teachers care about what students learn and try their best but some don't. But those who do outshine everyone else make a big impact on the students intellectually and personally. They have taught us not only to change the world but to be cool and positive people. The faculty workers at the school are very kind and try their best to make sure students have the best experience. Lacks AP classes but make up for it with a lot of College Readiness classes that can get you almost a whole semester ahead from professors a Bronx Community College and BMCC.

I know this through my own personal experience with the school.', 'I loved my experience at this school mostly because of the atmosphere. It is a very welcoming environment and feels like home. There was always someone I could go to with my issues, academic or personal. However, they could improve their efforts in college readiness (e.g. SAT/ACT prep). The faculty is small, which can be a pro and a con. The pro is that the administration gets to know the student body very well. However, it is often hard to balance the student-to-faculty ratio.', 'The best school I have ever stepped foot in. I am sad I graduated but the time came and we have to leave.

The school community is amazing. Even though we are all competitive by nature, there are few students who are not willing to lend a helpful hand. The classes are very challenging and led by experienced teachers. We have all kinds of AP and College NOW courses, something that has helped me get into the college mindset early.

This pro can also be a con sometimes, giving if the student isn\'t mature enough to handle these college related freedoms regrading academics, and they fail to earn the expected number of credits, then they\'ll be transferred to a credit recovery school. This hardly happens since the teachers here are one of best I\'ve encountered since my first year in middle school. The school setting can make you lazy when it comes to academics, making a simple essay seem like a 12 page report. Besides that, the work load is pretty manageable, and the classes aren\'t hard to pass. If you\'re an athlete I wouldn\'t recommend you to attend this school, the teams aren\'t that good. The school has PBAT\'s instead of regents exams. Overall, this is a good school to go to, just don\'t get your expectations too high.', ""My experience is good so far. We have a expanded amount of partnerships which allows the students to have access to applying for jobs and programs. I'd like the teachers to be more helpful and provide help on PBATS."", 'University Heights is realkt just an okay type of school. Walking in as a freshman, you’ll be pulled in multiple directions with having such a wide variety of sports, clubs and programs.

The teachers  and consulars are people who understand that we as teenagers will have problems and they help us figure out what we can do to solve it and how to both be a good student and also solve our own personal problems. The school is safe and there isn't much fighting in the area, all students respect each other and the teachers. It is with that respect we learn through them. As I got older I realize that the teacher we hated or dislike help us grow as an person, because of that I am very grateful for the help they give us. The consulars that talk to us and ask us how we are feeling can help us."", ""I'll make this short and sweet. UHeights is a gem of the South Bronx. It isn't the best school nor the worst, but each year my school continually strives to provide more than adequate education. In the Bronx, success for children may seem like a dream for the average minority student, but my school convinced me that I am more than just the color of my skin. At University Heights I was shown that in a sea of predominantly white colleges, I am just as, smart, talented, and skilled to succeed. One of its unique features is the number of programs that we have. I was able to travel abroad in my sophomore year because of the surplus of programs I partook in. Simply put, I old have wanted to spend my high school career anywhere else."", 'Unfortunately, my issues with this school comes from the many restrictions placed on students. Students are not allowed to wear the color red. As well that students are not even allowed to wear the sweater of their choice. They are only allowed to wear University Heights branded sweaters. Some students spend day and night in the school and should have the right to wear comfortable clothing, and express themselves.', ""Overall this school is a very good school. We have a lot of activities and great teachers that came from Ivy League institutions giving students help they need. Most teachers care about what students learn and try their best but some don't. But those who do outshine everyone else make a big impact on the students intellectually and personally. They have taught us not only to change the world but to be cool and positive people. The faculty workers at the school are very kind and try their best to make sure students have the best experience. Lacks AP classes but make up for it with a lot of College Readiness classes that can get you almost a whole semester ahead from professors a Bronx Community College and BMCC. The racial diversity here is >90%. The clubs and activities offered in freshmen year change my life for the better. This school may not be the best but offers very unique opportunities for those who are disadvantaged low income public high school students."", 'University Heights , is very academically challenging .It gave me the opportunity to put my best foot forward.The staff are very caring ,they are willing to help with any situation .The high school also offers support through mentors / having other opportunities such as extracurricular activities or sports .They have a wide  selection for student to join after school programs and they certainly keep you busy.I have to say my during my time in University Heights is enjoyable.', 'University Heights High School is one of the best schools in New York and the South Bronx. Though it is a small school, it is very diverse and very accepting and open minded. Bullying is something that is not seen in the school and regardless of race, gender and sexual orientation or religious beliefs you are assured to be accepted and loved. I know this through my own personal experience with the school.', 'I loved my experience at this school mostly because of the atmosphere. It is a very welcoming environment and feels like home. There was always someone I could go to with my issues, academic or personal. However, they could improve their efforts in college readiness (e.g. SAT/ACT prep). The faculty is small, which can be a pro and a con. The pro is that the administration gets to know the student body very well. However, it is often hard to balance the student-to-faculty ratio.', 'The best school I have ever stepped foot in. I am sad I graduated but the time came and we have to leave.

The work you get is high level work and it allows you to adapt to challenging papers or math problems.', 'Even though University Heights High School was not my first choice, I am thankful that I was ultimately placed there. The school community is amazing. Even though we are all competitive by nature, there are few students who are not willing to lend a helpful hand. The classes are very challenging and led by experienced teachers. We have all kinds of AP and College NOW courses, something that has helped me get into the college mindset early. The only thing I can complain about is the clubs and organizations.

One of my favorite experiences so far, was having a field day with the whole school at the end of the year. This school is unique is many different ways. One of the things that makes this school unique is that we only take one regents, which is English, because we're mostly a PBAT school.
