No one here fears for their safety."", 'The extracurricular that the school offers is largely academic, not necessarily creative. Out of the variety of clubs that are available, only three are geared toward artistic students: OPUS, Art Club, and The Ram (newspaper), only the latter of which has actual merit. Most, if not all clubs are disorganized, and members usually join clubs to put something on their college application.', 'The social scene at Ramsey is very cliquey; these students have known each other, and have been classmates since they were in Pre-K or kindergarten. If you are new, it is extremely difficult to make friends, and easy to feel lonely. The only way to really get involved in your school and community here is through sports. Ramsey High fully supports its athletics teams and athletes, usually at the expense of more academic, especially creative, fields. Even within sports, the funding and favor usually goes to the boys\' hockey, football, baseball, and basketball teams, over girl\'s field hockey, soccer, and softball. To be a ""ram,"" in the true sense of the word, is to be an athlete, not a just a student. If my school could bring equal importance to the arts as it did for sports, I think I would have enjoyed my time here more.\r As for organized school events, Ramsey does a great job with this. Some events we host include: Homecoming dance, Prom, various theater productions, jazz concerts, senior picnic, and project graduation. I don\'t think my school has ever poorly planned an event for its students, especially its seniors, which I am really happy with.', 'The teachers at Ramsey are probably the best benefit of attending this school, especially if you are on the honors track. I have found that most teachers are more engaged with their higher level classes and students, because they feel these students are more likely to be interested in, and apply the material outside of the classroom. Therefore, it is most likely to find a motivated honors student over a motivated CP student. I feel teachers could do more to encourage all students to be motivated to learn, no matter their ranking or level. All teachers at Ramsey, with the exception of some veteran staff, are always willing to work with you, and are compassionate about the heavy workload and sports activities that come with high school.', ""There's basically no diversity ethnically, because it's Ramsey. Mostly white, with less Asian and Spanish people. It's not usually an issue, but some people are just obnoxious. Sexual orientation is more diverse; I know a lot of people who identify as gay, lesbian, trans.\r Peer pressure is a thing with drugs and alcohol, but it's not a big deal if you're not into it. When people offer you drugs or alcohol, they're trying to be nice and polite by sharing. They don't actually want to waste their resources and money on you if you don't want it."", ""The science and math departments are absolutely terrible, but the rest of the school has relatively good teachers. Most genuinely want you to succeed. The scheduling process can get annoying, just because it's a small school, and by senior year you're probably taking specialized courses, especially if you're in APs. So, there are only one or two of each class, and it can be complicated. You may have to prioritize, but guidance helps as much as possible, if you go to them.\r The workload is oftentimes unmanageable. I don't think a teacher has ever assigned me more than 2.5 hours of homework for one class, but when four teachers assign 2.5 hours of homework, it definitely adds up. \r Popular elective classes include: sociology, psychology, human geography, anatomy, parenting ed, visual arts, photo, ceramics\r Well-Liked Classes include: hon world history, pre-calc, english I, french, biology"", ""There's a lot of drinking and weed outside of school, except a lot of kids get drunk for hockey, football, basketball, and sometimes soccer games. Besides that, the drug thing isn't an issue, and plenty of people avoid getting involved in it. The security is good; we have armed security, locked doors during classes, and security cameras, most of which are just annoying. Safety has never been an issue; they use the cameras more for getting kids in trouble with stupid stuff."", ""There's a healthy mix of clubs: academic ones- focused on math and science or on languages- and artsy ones- art club, OPUS. There's a school paper and two types of student government (congress and council). There's debate, Gay-Straight Alliance, mock trial, drama, a great band program, DECA (business) anything you could want. But the sports get the most attention, especially football, hockey, and basketball. Lacrosse is gaining popularity. Our best teams usually are soccer, field hockey, hockey, and basketball!! Tennis and baseball/softball are pretty good, too. Most people go to hockey and football games, though. There are definitely issues with how much certain coaches/advisors are paid, but that's an internal issue that should be taken up with the (terrible, sexist, and rude) athletic director, Grasso."", ""Some teachers are absolutely terrible. The math and science departments are pathetic. The teachers can't teach. English, history, world language, art, business are all pretty good, though."", ""A variety of clubs and extracurricular activities are available to students but many are not committed to them. Students only take part in them until freshman or sophomore year. It is rare to see students go through them till graduation. I would like to say more but I'm one of those students who stopped going to clubs because they were no fun."", 'There are some teachers who put their best but there are teachers who let students do whatever they want, which can be disturbing to other students. The science department needs to reevaluate their teachers; many students complain that teachers do not teach well. Teachers do not provide explanations and just say that it is. It is not just the science teachers, but there are many teachers in the English department who just give students essays and poetry questions assuming that practice will allow students to actually learn something. But they do not understand that students will not take their works seriously if they do not understand what they are doing. These teachers should change their teaching methods to actually help students understand and do better the next time.', ""Honors classes are decent; non-honors are a joke. If you want to get into a good college, do a few extracurriculars in schools and then move outside of the school to do volunteer work, internships, etc. Without the outside experience, it's difficult to be recognized within a college pool because of how closed off Ramsey is to everyone else."", 'Love the extracurriculars \r Most teachers are great\r Great sense of community', 'High school is a time to learn about yourself. Though I still have a long road to go, I really love it here. At times I can feel stressed out or lonely, but there are welcoming teachers, friends, and peers. We have a ton of school spirit and way to get involved in clubs and activities. Challenging courses are offered and there is always someone there to help you if you need it.', ""It's basically all junk food, and the lines are long everyday. The choices get pretty boring after about a month, and it is very expensive. Most of the time there is extra food and students still get small portions. The muffins are really delicious and everyone buys them but they are unhealthy like everything else. When it gets warmer most people go into town to eat."", 'The culture of partying has never really changed, and everyone hears about certain kids getting suspended. However, other policies are pretty relaxed and you would have to do something really bad to get in trouble. The guidance office is very helpful though, and we meet with them at least once a year to talk about the future. Other staff are good, although some are bad with responding to email.', ""There are definitely good and bad teachers at RHS. Many of them are nice, and helpful.

The teachers are getting new Ipads almost every year and the Ipads the students get have no use.

Of course I have met some of my closest friends here but overall the Mount Sinai High School student body is a bunch of immature, ignorant, and overprivileged teenagers. The majority of the students participate in sports, which is a very good thing when it comes to many teams being exceptionally good. But that said it leaves them very cocky and also very mean and almost ignorant to the other students who don\'t partake in sports, like the more academic or artistic kids. The only exceptions to this would be if the student is rich, which Mount Sinai is definitely not lacking in that department. Coming to this school i wasn\'t sporty and I wasn\'t ""rich"" and that didn\'t sit right with a lot of the kids. The students are very focused on ""cliques"", their small and exclusive group of friends. Meaning that if there is a new kid who doesn\'t fit into a clique, the people of that clique will ignore them and even talk about them and cause drama. The teachers are very hit and miss; you either have a really good class with a really good teacher, or a teacher who has no business being in this line of work. And let me tell you, as a student it became very hard to be eager to learn when then teacher wasn\'t eager to teach. But many teachers are okay and they do offer a lot of great classes including AP classes. And although the students let this go to their head, this school has a very nice reputation for sports. Overall, I would only come to this school if you have thick enough skin to not give a damn about what any of this ignorant, overprivileged idiots have to say and focus on what classes you need to take to get out of here and go far away to a great college; that\'s how I managed to make it this far.', 'Primarily, Mount Sinai is focused on sports rather than academic and science programs.

They are in the process of adding more courses particularly in art.

Of course I have met some of my closest friends here but overall the Mount Sinai High School student body is a bunch of immature, ignorant, and overprivileged teenagers. The majority of the students participate in sports, which is a very good thing when it comes to many teams being exceptionally good. But that said it leaves them very cocky and also very mean and almost ignorant to the other students who don\'t partake in sports, like the more academic or artistic kids. The only exceptions to this would be if the student is rich, which Mount Sinai is definitely not lacking in that department. Coming to this school i wasn\'t sporty and I wasn\'t ""rich"" and that didn\'t sit right with a lot of the kids. The students are very focused on ""cliques"", their small and exclusive group of friends. Meaning that if there is a new kid who doesn\'t fit into a clique, the people of that clique will ignore them and even talk about them and cause drama. The teachers are very hit and miss; you either have a really good class with a really good teacher, or a teacher who has no business being in this line of work. And let me tell you, as a student it became very hard to be eager to learn when then teacher wasn\'t eager to teach. But many teachers are okay and they do offer a lot of great classes including AP classes. And although the students let this go to their head, this school has a very nice reputation for sports. Overall, I would only come to this school if you have thick enough skin to not give a damn about what any of this ignorant, overprivileged idiots have to say and focus on what classes you need to take to get out of here and go far away to a great college; that\'s how I managed to make it this far.', 'Primarily, Mount Sinai is focused on sports rather than academic and science programs.

North Star Academy Charter School of Newark,"['North Star Academy prepares their students very well academically and prepares students for the workload of college. North Star doesn’t prepare students for the social aspects of college. North Star attempts to add more social events such as pep rallies, but overall North Star focuses heavily on the academic aspects and disregards the social aspects.', 'One benefit of attending North Star is the provided college-level courses that helps to prepare students for the rigor that college presents. Additionally, I think that the efforts to make the college process as efficient as possible are really helpful; the juniors and seniors get a lot more assistance with the college process and what to look forward to. What I would like to change is the disciplinary system and the relationship between students and teachers. I feel like the school goes a bit overboard with how they punish students, especially for small things like having different color socks or not wearing a belt. Additionally, there are students that may be going through things at home and then when they come to school, they’re forced by teachers to “fix the attitude” or they go to the deans. I feel there are very few teachers that actually make an effort to understand why the student is having a bad day or why they have an attitude and try to help the students.', 'North Star is a school that focuses on the academic development of their students and helps to ensure that they are on the right path to college and being successful. Although the work may be vigorous at times, the chancs of reaching success and overall becoming a wonderful, well- rounded individual is extremely high here. I would suggest this school to everyone.', ""At North Star Academy You will experience challenges with Academics. You are pushed to your greatest ability and if you aren't doing well your granted numerous opportunities to gain that extra help."", 'North Star is a very rigorous school and there is a lot of heavy focus on grades, homework, and the college process.', 'In this school, the push you to be the best you can be in all aspects of being a student. I came here m junior year of high school, and I can honestly say that I have learned more here in one year than I did at my old high school. The teachers are very caring and really want you to do good and be the best you can be.', 'My school is a charter school in Newark, NJ. I like that my school offers a non traditional class for all sophomores, juniors, and seniors. The options for this class are endless and range from music, cooking, fitness, LGBTQ societies, and so many more groups. I personally did music technology which quickly became a favorite hobby of mine. I enjoyed this class so much that I will be continuing this work while in college.', 'I like that North Star is a high school that prepares me for college. It is a rigorous school, with serious teachers that provide me with college level work and push me to do my best without holding my hand through the whole process. I would like to see a change in the sports area so that there are more sports which can attract the interests of more of my peers.', 'I liked the teaching especially AP courses which helps prepare students for college classes and also the free SAT prep which the school offered for juniors and seniors which really helped in boosting most students SAT scores tremendously. What I would change about Northstar Academy would be their lunch which I feel needs to be improved, asides from that it’s a really great school.', 'The courses of the school and the teachers helped me learn a lot. I was able to take 3 AP classes while in my high school year and I was also able to learn how to love math even more then i do now.', 'In North Stat they teach you structure and discipline at a young age. With the assignments and the rules they teach you at any age how to be responsible and I appreciate them for it.', 'This school focuses so heavily on academics and ensure that almost 100% of their students make it to and through college.', ""I loved how North Star prepared me for the rigor that colleges and universities around the country would have. With the menacing amount of homework and projects, I really did feel like I was on my way to do something great with my life. North Star's alum are a testament to how exactly it prepares its students. With alum at several prestigious colleges such as, Harvard, Yale, Brown and even more. Not every school is perfect of course and has its flaws but North Star makes strides to be the best it can be for residents of Newark."", 'I like how focused the school is on getting the best out of the students. The staff ensures that the student work their hardest and take advantage of all opportunities that come their way. The faculty is very committed.', 'My overall experience at this school has been fairly good. The lessons and units are designed in a way that really helps to teach information and help it stick with you. At North Star, the lessons not only slowly real in new information and techniques that build off of previous knowledge that we’ve learned but there is constantly review from previous lessons that make sure our knowledge of the content is sharp in our head. There are very high expectations for students within the school, much higher than that of other schools but with that comes constant encouragement from administrators and data that proves that we are doing the best work here at North Star. As a teenager, school may naturally seem unfair and I may have times where I want to give up but through those times I have been reminded of my future and the happiness I would endure by holding myself up to high expectations now so that I can be successful in the future.', ""I like the education opportunity but that's about it.

North Star doesn’t prepare students for the social aspects of college. North Star attempts to add more social events such as pep rallies, but overall North Star focuses heavily on the academic aspects and disregards the social aspects.', 'One benefit of attending North Star is the provided college-level courses that helps to prepare students for the rigor that college presents. Additionally, I think that the efforts to make the college process as efficient as possible are really helpful; the juniors and seniors get a lot more assistance with the college process and what to look forward to. What I would like to change is the disciplinary system and the relationship between students and teachers. I feel like the school goes a bit overboard with how they punish students, especially for small things like having different color socks or not wearing a belt. Additionally, there are students that may be going through things at home and then when they come to school, they’re forced by teachers to “fix the attitude” or they go to the deans. I feel there are very few teachers that actually make an effort to understand why the student is having a bad day or why they have an attitude and try to help the students.', 'North Star is a school that focuses on the academic development of their students and helps to ensure that they are on the right path to college and being successful.

I like that my school offers a non traditional class for all sophomores, juniors, and seniors. The options for this class are endless and range from music, cooking, fitness, LGBTQ societies, and so many more groups. I personally did music technology which quickly became a favorite hobby of mine. I enjoyed this class so much that I will be continuing this work while in college.', 'I like that North Star is a high school that prepares me for college.

What I would change about Northstar Academy would be their lunch which I feel needs to be improved, asides from that it’s a really great school.', 'The courses of the school and the teachers helped me learn a lot. I was able to take 3 AP classes while in my high school year and I was also able to learn how to love math even more then i do now.', 'In North Stat they teach you structure and discipline at a young age.

At North Star, the lessons not only slowly real in new information and techniques that build off of previous knowledge that we’ve learned but there is constantly review from previous lessons that make sure our knowledge of the content is sharp in our head. There are very high expectations for students within the school, much higher than that of other schools but with that comes constant encouragement from administrators and data that proves that we are doing the best work here at North Star. As a teenager, school may naturally seem unfair and I may have times where I want to give up but through those times I have been reminded of my future and the happiness I would endure by holding myself up to high expectations now so that I can be successful in the future.', ""I like the education opportunity but that's about it.

Each and every day in the morning, the principal and teachers remind the students that we are a part of a community as we all chant, “When one succeeds, we all succeed.” This notion is demonstrated through the students boisterous applause when one received recognition, or through the teamwork present within study groups and after school tutorials. Students and teachers will persevere and work together to make sure that every goal is met. Even though North Star is a very supportive community, one thing I would like to change are the strict regulations. It is understandable to have rules within a school to keep everything in order. However, it becomes a hindrance for a student’s education if a student is sent to the office or face suspension for a small act. Based on the rules, the flaw within a student’s behavior should be dealt with through a retribution that is equivalent to what was done.', 'The academics at North Star Academy is unmatched.

North Star does a great job in expanding the students' horizon in life. However, I believe the school's true understanding of Newark is flawed where only the negative connotations of Newark is expressed. I believe that when the teachers who teach the black students listen to the students' experiences of being a person that actually lives in Newark and actually tries to learn from them as well, there can be a mutual understanding between the two parties.

This school only cared about it's athletes and those who are academically gifted. The guidance counselors gave no advice and would tell kids to apply to a college that wasn't fit for them.

It’s super diverse, everyone is friendly, easy to make friends, not cliquey, it’s like one huge family and everyone gets along. Teachers are amazing they are kind, relatable, and prepare us well for exams. Plenty of AP’s are offered, many programs like culinary, performing arts, and cosmetology. Security is taken very seriously, a lot of clubs of offered, and plenty of honor societies. The sports teams are great. Central has shaped who I am and I’m so glad I didn’t listen to the rumors about central. In the end I made so many amazing friends from all types of backgrounds; ethnically and educationally. We all have our own ambitions, passions, and love to talk about them. This is a very promising school. I hope one day Central gets the true name it deserves, being a warm and welcoming home for every person of every background and accommodating to any dreams and passions that you have.', ""I've recently graduated Central and one thing that I can say for sure is that it is an amazing school. As a student, I was treated with respect and I felt like I could talk to teachers about my issues.When it comes to academics, I'd say Central is at the top of its game. From cosmetology to AP classes to performing arts to culinary, we have it all. The only reason that I'm not giving Central five stars is because it can do a better job at letting students know what resources are available before it's too late (ex. honor societies). For the most part, teachers are generally caring. Favoritism is obvious sometimes but it gives you a taste of what the real world is about.Central is pretty diverse and although there are cliques, I feel like there's a group for everybody."", 'Central overall is a pretty decent school. The food is terrible so I recommend going out for lunch. On a positive note, the diversity is great.', 'Valley Stream Central High School is a great school it has very helpful staff and great staff.

You see a lot of friendly faces and there is never a dull moment here. Staff members are always looking out for the best interest of the students and are always there to talk about your future.

The staff got to know each child personally and met their individual needs. There are many clubs to choose from and so many opportunities for the children to reach academic heights.', 'Central is unlike the average high school in that it has a performing arts program, culinary program, cosmetology program, and offers a wide range of AP courses. Students can take a movement class instead of gym or learn about the beauty world. Their theatrical productions and bi-annual concerts are held to a larger caliber because they consistently not only blow away the audience but perform to the industry standard.', 'Though I am a new incoming student at Valley Stream Central High School, I was received with open arms. People have been nothing but kind and friendly. Teachers do a very good job at explaining the curriculum.', 'In the heart of Valley Stream Central HS positively represents the community.

Guidance  and psychologists are always available as well.', 'VSC is One Of The Smaller High Schools. My School Only Fits Grades 10-12 due to size reasons. It isnt that bad though, for the most part the teachers do thrive to get you where you need to go, which helps academically. Its Not The Best But I mean I would let my son Go.

Overall I’ll give it 3.8/5', ""When first stepping into central I was scared because there were so many kids that were taller, bigger, and just different from me. However, this changed throughout my years at central. Everyone was so open and you could find a new friend there in seconds. Realizing later on that since I was different, it doesn't mean that everyone is going to look down upon you or look at you weird, it means that people are going to want to talk to you about that difference and show there differences as well when they open up.

The principal cares deeply for students wellbeing. And our guidance counselors are very involved with the college process,  offering help at every turn. However, in my years here, I have seen administrators who were unprofessional and staff who could care less about their students. I also have found that our student body is not very supportive of each other. There are a lot of cliques and a new student could possibly feel unwelcomed. The students here are also somewhat disrespectful but what high school student isn't? If I had to attend this school all over again, I would. This is because when I have struggled with subjects help was always available. And when I needed help with life problems there was always a staff member to confide in. I would recommend this school to any student about to attend high school. This school is one of the best and Central will always have a place in my heart."", 'Teachers & staff are always willing to help you grow and fix any issues you may come across.

It’s super diverse, everyone is friendly, easy to make friends, not cliquey, it’s like one huge family and everyone gets along. Teachers are amazing they are kind, relatable, and prepare us well for exams. Plenty of AP’s are offered, many programs like culinary, performing arts, and cosmetology. Security is taken very seriously, a lot of clubs of offered, and plenty of honor societies. The sports teams are great. Central has shaped who I am and I’m so glad I didn’t listen to the rumors about central. In the end I made so many amazing friends from all types of backgrounds; ethnically and educationally. We all have our own ambitions, passions, and love to talk about them. This is a very promising school. I hope one day Central gets the true name it deserves, being a warm and welcoming home for every person of every background and accommodating to any dreams and passions that you have.', ""I've recently graduated Central and one thing that I can say for sure is that it is an amazing school. As a student, I was treated with respect and I felt like I could talk to teachers about my issues.When it comes to academics, I'd say Central is at the top of its game. From cosmetology to AP classes to performing arts to culinary, we have it all. The only reason that I'm not giving Central five stars is because it can do a better job at letting students know what resources are available before it's too late (ex. honor societies). For the most part, teachers are generally caring. Favoritism is obvious sometimes but it gives you a taste of what the real world is about.Central is pretty diverse and although there are cliques, I feel like there's a group for everybody."", 'Central overall is a pretty decent school. The food is terrible so I recommend going out for lunch. On a positive note, the diversity is great.', 'Valley Stream Central High School is a great school it has very helpful staff and great staff.

The student body can be described as diverse and filled with immense school spirit. They are always active in various clubs and activity that happen in Central.', 'My 4 children all attended valley stream central high school. The staff got to know each child personally and met their individual needs. There are many clubs to choose from and so many opportunities for the children to reach academic heights.', 'Central is unlike the average high school in that it has a performing arts program, culinary program, cosmetology program, and offers a wide range of AP courses. Students can take a movement class instead of gym or learn about the beauty world. Their theatrical productions and bi-annual concerts are held to a larger caliber because they consistently not only blow away the audience but perform to the industry standard.', 'Though I am a new incoming student at Valley Stream Central High School, I was received with open arms.

Due to its Size Facilities arent great in size. Games like basketball and any outdoor sport other than tenis has to be done at our local town field. Overall I’ll give it 3.8/5', ""When first stepping into central I was scared because there were so many kids that were taller, bigger, and just different from me. However, this changed throughout my years at central. Everyone was so open and you could find a new friend there in seconds. Realizing later on that since I was different, it doesn't mean that everyone is going to look down upon you or look at you weird, it means that people are going to want to talk to you about that difference and show there differences as well when they open up.

The principal cares deeply for students wellbeing. And our guidance counselors are very involved with the college process,  offering help at every turn. However, in my years here, I have seen administrators who were unprofessional and staff who could care less about their students. I also have found that our student body is not very supportive of each other. There are a lot of cliques and a new student could possibly feel unwelcomed. The students here are also somewhat disrespectful but what high school student isn't? If I had to attend this school all over again, I would. This is because when I have struggled with subjects help was always available. And when I needed help with life problems there was always a staff member to confide in.

I have spent three full years at this school and I recommend this school to anyone I get the chance to.', 'This school is very diverse. Your experience is definitely contingent or depends on your shop class. The quality of classes ranges from shop to shop. Overall most people at SCVTHS are really nice and the shop teachers are usually very good at their trade. SCVTHS has a very inclusive environment (well from my experience).', 'I attend the Somerset County Vocational and Technical High School (VoTech for short) for the Theater Arts. The Theater Arts program has taught me how to efficiently work in and outside of the classroom room. I have strengthened my time management, communicating, and networking skills (to name a few.) This professional training environment has been the best possible structure to prepare me for real world experiences. I have been respected and treated like an adult by the entire faculty, I never feel lesser than and I am encouraged to share my opinion on everything and anything. Furthermore, I am currently going on college auditions for a BFA in Acting. At one of my auditions there was an interview at the end of it where they questioned me about the VoTech program I attended. They have previously accepted three other students from this program, and they actually said, ""You all are at such an advantage come audition season, it\'s crazy."" I am so thankful for the education I received here.', 'I liked how this school allows you to chose which occupation to be in, and you can pick the one that interests you the most.', 'I was part of the academy for health and medical sciences, i program i truly love. The teachers were great and the courses were challenging and perfect. The administration was not the best though. The academic advisors were great but guidance counselors were rarely available and you often felt distanced.', 'I wish there were more sports and more involvement of the student in the actual school, such as pep rallies.', 'My experience at Vo-tech was okay. The faculty and staff are friendly and helpful. The teachers are all good, especially the shop teachers. Made tons of friends due to the small size of school and classrooms. I would go back through high school at Votech.', 'I had a horrible experience at votech. The administration would continually use members of my shop to their own advantage, giving us the worst class times with awful teachers, changing our schedules mid year, and dropping bombshells on us like changing graduation policies less than two months before graduation. Despite this, they always expected us to showboat the excellence of our program to the outside community. My experience can be summed up by asking, ""what awful change will they make next?""', 'My best friends all go there and say its amazing. Everyone loves to get up in the clouds with their imagination. Super creative and accepting', 'Somerset Votech, Is a really a school to experience! It is a very Tight knit community of talented and diverse students who are knowledgeable in their own trade. The Teachers and CTE Intstructor work closely with the students to ensure they get the most out of their secondary education.', 'Somerset County Votech works hard to get their students involved in all aspects of their education. The school values hands on learning. There are an array of health and science labs, welding and art labs, auto labs, and cosmetology labs for the students to learn by doing. The school is full of wonderful facilities and opportunities for the students to learn and develop their skills.', ""I am a Theatre Arts student with Vocal Music at SCVTS.  It has been an amazing school offering intense training that has allowed me to pursue my  career choice of acting in college.  The program is always changing and improving to benefit the students.  The staff is amazing and a professional group of teachers that not only teach at this hs but also teach at colleges, private instruction, and professional theatre.  I am a shared time student here so these classes satisfy my hs electives, gym and arts requirements but you may also attend as a full time student.  Lots of opportunities at this school for many vocational careers.  I'm really going to miss this high school, it's been a great experience."", ""Somerset County Vocational Technical HS has the most diverse students. All have their own thing, the way they do it, and no one is judged for it. Teachers can be your best friend if you do what they ask, it's not too hard, and it's not too easy. The programs also known as shops are fantastic, and most instructors will do whatever they can to get you a career in your field by the time you graduate from here. Clubs could use a little work, but Ms. Gotti the advisor for Rotary Interact is the most active, and is the nicest person you could meet. She will be there to help you, and she is a fantastic teacher along side that. Other clubs could be a little more active e.g; Red Cross Club and FFOA, otherwise the school has a great choice of options. If you attend here, I suggest going full time since share time miss one whole period for traveling time."", 'Commitment in the clubs that I was in was not always high.', 'The school was unique because it had people that attended from all over the county plus Hunterdon county', 'Most of the teachers were nice and very down to earth. Some of them understood us and could relate to us. The teachers were good.', 'I love after school sports (softball) I have been with my team since freshmen year and like my fellew team members n coach.', 'I like that students  have different shop choices and are able to go full or share time to school.', 'My shop teacher is the best. He goes over n beyond for students.

Which makes them entitled and think they have power over others. Most students are disrespectful to others and teachers. It is sad to see my peers behave in this way. Some of the faculty is a little overtop. The language department has horrible teachers within it. Either way the combination of rude students and teachers are  not a good mix. There is a rising drug issue within the school, which the school system has themselves to blame. Unlike most schools, Montville will not punish their students. They treat the kids who cheat and skip school better than a straight A student. They are essenntially push-overs.', 'I loved that there were a lot of options of extracurricular classes I could take. Some of the teachers here helped me academically and personally through my four years. If I could change something, I would provide more help through the college process. I barely had any help with it. I also wish that the school provided more help with providing internships or some academic classes that would help with the majors that one aspires to pursue.', 'During my 4 years at Montville Township High School, I have experienced some great moments and met some amazing teachers. I would say the teaching here is great, but it would be better if teachers got kids more ready for college.', 'Montville High School is a great school to have your typical high school experience. Teachers are ok some of them care about students education.', ""The school is good, it's the kids that are annoying and need to grow up. A lot of them are just immature. Otherwise the programs are amazing and the teachers are always looking to help you become better. The art department is out of this world."", ""The teachers at MTHS care about their students succeeding and offer extra help whether it is before school, in the morning, during lunch, or after school. If they notice a student is falling behind or doesn't understand a particular topic, due to their grades, they will bring it to that student's attention and try their best to provide a better understanding for that student in what they're struggling in. The atmosphere at MTHS isn't the friendliest, and what is making me give this school 3 stars is how they went about HIB here. I had many cases of HIB in the past, where I was the victim, and had much proof that the HIB took place, yet the students who bullied me, never got in trouble or their punishment never followed through. So therefore, what was the point of me even bringing the HIB to my school's attention?"", ""The school is excellent for preparing high school students for college, but can be too tough in certain classes, causing students to stress, panic, and even cheat. This makes the environment unhealthily competitive. Besides this, there are very few things that could be complained about. The school's academics and extracurriculars are strong, and the faculty is mostly understanding and passionate about their roles at the school.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Montville Township High School is a decent school, but for the amount of money that people in the town pay, the teachers should be better.

The overall school environment was very accepting to all communities and bullying was definitely kept to a minimum. School itself was very large/spacious and was maintained very well. The memories/experiences I created here allowed me to be well prepared for college. All in all, a very wonderful school.', 'Monroe Township High School offers a multicultural environment, which makes all students feel included.  This school offers many Honors and Advance Placement classes, in addition to some college level classes.  There are many extracurricular actives and clubs to join, that meets many different interests.  The school also provides after school tutoring and extra help in math, science and foreign languages.', 'This school is really safe and secure thanks to the many security guards. We also have many resources available like our library, tech center, since we use ipads, and we have a special class called AVID that prepares kids who participate for college.', 'There were many clubs to be involved in and students and parents were very involved with sports.For the most part the teachers are wonderful.  The only issue I have had was if there was ever an issue with a teacher it is blown off.', 'I had 2 children in the school district and each were treated individually. There were so many different opportunities to expand their learning and prepare for college or future plans.', ""I couldn't have asked for a better high school experience. I look back fondly on my time at the school. I was able to get involved and make friends that I know I'm going to have for the rest of my life. I received a great education and built a solid foundation for my academic future and career."", 'My experience at MTHS has been a good one. The school is relatively new and has good opportunities for students.', 'The school is very new, but is already very overcrowded.  Class sizes are large.  Most teachers are very good, and there are many elective offerings.  Biggest issue is the overcrowding situation.', 'MTHS was an amazing high school for me.  My class sizes were relatively small, averaging 25 kids.  My teachers were almost always very approachable and kind.  I felt that overall, it was very safe and organized; I never felt worried or concerned to attend school.  The food was average, some days better than others, but they do help a lot in preparing students for college and there are more than enough opportunities for success.', ""The culture of this school is abysmal. No one cares about each other. There's no diversity, just a bunch of white and second generation brown kids acting like they live in the hood even thought they all drive bmw's and their parents make 400K+. A handful of teachers are actually really good and are actually able to teach, but the rest for the most part have no idea what they're doing. The administration cares more about not letting kids drink coffee and dress coding people than giving us good resources and actually getting us to learn something, as well as doing something about all the hateful things spread around the school. Our tech department can't even keep the wifi working, and they always mess our iPads up by randomly wiping them. If you go down to tech, 9/10 they will tell you to just do a hard reset, never mind that your iPad's home button doesn't even work. All in all this was one of the worst experiences in my life and I wish i never moved here."", ""I am currently a senior at Monroe Township High School and can honestly say that I have enjoyed my four years at this school. I have gotten a wonderful, well-rounded education, been involved in many clubs and honor societies, as well as multiple varsity level sports teams. I have made memories to last a lifetime and wouldn't change a thing about my experience here."", 'Education is very good. The way the material is taught is good. Some things need to change is the grading of the teachers. Some teachers are stricter thsn others. Also too much use of drugs and vape. Also 3-4 tests each day is too much. Teachers need to make a test schedule so students have time to prepare for tests and quizes. Drugs in our school need to stop. Over all everything else is good.', 'So far my experience at Monroe Township High School has been great. The school was built recently and the interior and exterior are very well designed. All my teachers this year are great and they care about what they are teaching. There is an overwhelming amount of clubs available and there is a club for everyone. There are many resources that the school offers and if you seek help there are always places to get help.', 'Majority of the teachers put in the effort to help you succeed; others leave you hanging. You get the most out of utilizing the free afterschool tutoring programs.', 'Monroe Township High School offers many different courses that are specific to a field one may be interested in when they go off to college. It helps prepare you to figure out which subjects you like and which ones do not suit you as well.', 'Monroe is a pretty good school. The school provides students with a ton of resources for extra help. We have writing labs, tutors available in the library, CMac, Biology help, and more. The school also provides students with iPads which enhances learning for me. It is an easy way to take nots, write essays, and do projects. The lunch sucks, not because the food is bad, but because you never get enough. As a student athlete, I need to consume more calories than other students and the portions the school provides for us is never enough. I know it\'s a state thing or some kind of law that we have to be ""healthy"" and all that, but is not getting enough calories  in a day ""healthy?"" No. So I bring extra food to school with me or buy multiple sacks during lunch. It\'s annoying.

Most teachers are very knowledgeable and qualified for the job.', ""it's bad in the means of the small amount of people that participate in after school activities compared to the school in its entirety. there are so many great programs offered in our school that are not taken advantage of by more students. it's a shame because the quality of some of these programs specifically drama are amazing and I have attended several myself. for a high school play the craftsmanship of the set to the enthusiasm of the cast is remarkable. the awards the drama club has been given need to be told and praised more by the students and faculty."", ""While yes there are great teachers in place at Lakeland that I've encountered, there are many lacking. During my time at Lakeland I've had teachers incapable of teaching and updating their teaching skills with the availability of technology and because of that the knowledge that could've been captured was lost. But because of their age and years given to the school they stay. There are also many teachers who's opinions are so holy to them they cannot be told otherwise, making sitting in their class the least of anyone's worries. But I must applaud those who go above and beyond, specifically in the art department. if it wasn't for my love of art and having these teachers I truly believe I would absolutely be counting the days to graduation more than I already am. The art department at Lakeland is extremely underrated and deserves so much more recognition in all that they do for the students that pass through their classes."", ""It's really a great school, as much as some kids complain about their high schools. We're really fortunate here - we may not have air conditioning, which kinda sucks, but the majority of the school year is freezing cold anyway. The teachers are all super passionate about their subjects, and we have a lot of fun and interesting characters in the school - their personalities are really entertaining and unique. Some of our school's resources are stretched a bit thin, though, and having to adhere to state nutrition rules really sucks because we can't do bake sales during school or have a breakfast stand in the morning anymore, but you can't really blame the school for that when it's the state's fault."", 'The school offers many groups, activities and support.

We do our best to have all of our varsity sports teams involved in events around the area, we have countless clubs that have diverse groups of students, and the teachers and staff are all friendly whether you know them personally or not. What makes us unique is our pep rallies. Everything about pep rally catches every grades attention, even the freshman despite their underclassmen inexperience. Our pep rallies had EVERYONE involved, teachers, lunch ladies, students, administration, etc. They were always loud, fun, and were always something the school looked forward to because it showed our incredible school spirit.', ""My overall experience is really great. The past four years have been very memorable and I would not want to trade it for anything else. During the football games, the school's spirit was unreal. We had so much school spirit and cheer on the football players. I made so many new friends as well. If I could do it all over again I would choose this school because it made my years very memorable."", 'Teachers are very involved with their students.

For example key club is a club meant fo community service and they do amazing things. Or the yoga club where you can go to relieve stress.', ""My overall experience in this school has been amazing. I've met some of my long time friends here, have learned so much about myself & my education and what works and what doesn't, and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. I love my school."", ""All the teachers are very nice & down to heart. Even if you didn't have one of the teachers you can still always go to them & talk to them. & with the teachers you did have they're like another parent, you can go to them w your problems & they try to help you out best they can."", 'I really like the principal, Mrs. Ruscavage.  I can tell from my experience that she cares for the students who attend Matawan High School.', ""Like most high schools. Matawan has group of people that stat to themselves. Which can make it hard to meet new friends sometimes. But for the most part the school is very diverse and accepting\r  And we always support each other. It's a great place to grow and when your find the people you really get alon with and love you will be great full for the experience . The teachers at Matawan are also amazing. They really care about you and your education. For example, I had physics and had to stay after school everyday for help and my physics teacher had no problem. She answered all my question and really mad me feel comfortable being able to stay after."", ""The cafeteria had more than enough room for everyone in all lunch periods. The lunch menu had a good variety during the week; there was never a chance you'd be eating the same thing everyday unless you so choose to. The quality and healthy food options expanded dramatically within the four years I attended my school; all the changes were for the better. If you did have a dietary restriction, there wasn't a separate lunch you could get, but they had plenty of options to choose from if you did have a restricted diet."", ""The administration at my school was just like the administration at any other school. Sometimes they'd overreact, but for the most part all their actions were justifiable. The guidance counselors were always there if you needed them and the office staff was friendly and approachable. They never took situations like bullying lightly. If there was a problem, EVERYONE was informed about it and reminded how not tolerated it was. Dress codes went with write-ups, but you had to be blatantly not following the dress code to get in trouble. Attendance was strictly monitored and you were put on a contract if you didn't follow their attendance policy."", 'The school spirit at my school was.. intense. People went all out for sports teams, I mean theme nights were everyone would dress like our mascot, the husky. Everyone was always covered head to toe with Matawan gear and colors at games. We had our mainstream teams that people would show up for like basketball and football. They dedicated sections on the bleachers to our ""dog pound"". Some people even showed up to our less popular sports teams games like bowling and tennis. I\'d never seen a school with more school pride than our own. You could really tell it made all the difference for the teams as well to have all that support. Attending a sports game at Matawan was definitely an experience.', ""Out of the dozens of teachers I had during my time at Matawan Regional, I only had one poor teacher who only wasn't as good because she was so smart she had a hard time communicating her ideas to the rest of us. The quality of the teachers were none like I could ever imagine. They were so personable and didn't treat there room as a dictatorship; it was always a give and take. All my teachers loved to hear what the students had to say and would in turn, develop their teach styles accordingly. If you had a question, they'd answer it, but always gave you an answer that really made you need to think and make your own connections. When I graduated high school, I was more upset about the teachers I was leaving than anything else.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

The teachers are good. Most of them really care about your future and try to help you while some just assign work and leave the rest up to you. I want to change the library policy at columbia. Most of the time it is closed and when its open they allow an extremely low amount of people into the library. The school is dirty. There are rats in the school.

Throughout my years in this school I have had my fair share of hardships and challenges, the counselors this school provides and the constant help they're willing to give I have never felt as if I  wasn't able to talk to someone about what I was going through. Hauppauge High School aims to be a safe, welcoming environment for all of its students, teachers, and families; the constant care and fundraisers they offer is truly amazing and never fails to impress me. Hauppauge High School offers a diverse range of opportunities for students to participate in after school clubs, actives, and sports. No matter what grade you're in or who you are you always feel like you have a voice and are important to this school."", 'I liked that at Hauppauge High School, students were able to create personal relationships with their teachers. Most teachers were readily abailable if a student came to them with a problem, always willing to help. If one thing had to change, I would suggest there should be a greater involvement in sports. The atheletes deserve a student section for support during their games.', ""I like the diversity in courses and the opportunities that are given at this school. The teachers and administrators here do their best to help their students to reach their goals and inspire them to be great. A problem I have about this school is that there aren't exactly classes for students who want to pursue engineering as a career. There are robotics classes and computer classes that can help, but no classes centered solely around engineering to help their kids prepare for what they will learn in college"", 'Hauppauge is great everyone gives all they can to help you. The athletics need work though. When it comes to college they help you do whatever is necessary to go where you want to go.', 'Hauppauge High School has allowed me to have an amazing high school experience and it has given me great opportunities. I felt that I was able to give back to my community because of this school and I was able to prosper to be the best me I could be.', ""Haulage High school is a safe and friendly place. The teachers are great and are always there to help. The school is a fun environment that isn't a pain to go to everyday."", 'Hauppauge High School was my home for the past 4 years. Attending this high school was a privilege and it helped me find my path in life. Hauppauge High School has an incredible amount of honors/AP/IB programs and offers a multitude of extracurricular activities that benefit every type of student. I was able to become the well rounded, thriving individual that I am today because of where I went to high school. The staff here are excellent and are always willing to ensure a students success.', 'I really like Hauppauge High School. I was involved in many extra  curricular activities including sports and clubs. They offer the students many options no matter what your interests are.', 'The administration protects their own rather then their students.  They will always question the kids and not the adults.  They turn a blind eye to bullying by coaches and teachers.  They deny that they have any complaints against their staff and conduct bogus investigations.  This is not a good environment for kids.  Please read all the student reviews.  It is very telling that this is not a good school.  If you are new to the area, stay away from this school district.  Better choices are Commack and Smithtown.  Look at their numbers in comparison.', ""They give a lot of funding for the arts, which I really liked. The theater program is very strong, and the chamber choir is incredible. However, I really dislike their policy for bullying and physical fights. If someone is involved in a fight, whether or not they actually swung a punch, they are suspended. The administration doesn't want to take the time to deal with figuring out whose fault it was, so they punish everyone."", ""The academics at my school are very good. The teachers really try their best for the most part to not only teach the material but to make sure students understand it. Some even go a step further to inspire students to do their best. The curriculum offer is diverse including IB, AP, Honors and Regents level courses. The scheduling process is pretty efficient but can be overwhelming to pick classes you will enjoy. The workload, especially in the advanced course can become stressful and unmanageable at times but I think it's all worth it. There is always extra help as long as you ask a teacher."", 'My school is for the most part a very accepting community of people. Students with special educational needs have great accommodations. There is a huge amount of student involvement in clubs, organizations, and sports because there are so many things to join. There is hardly ethnic/racial tension that I witness however this may be due to a majority white student body. There is a low number of minorities which can be a challenge to fit in.', ""The students at the school are generally very involved in extra curricular activities. Some of the clubs include Language clubs (Spanish, French, German), DECA, Student Council, Best Buddies, Interact Club, National Honor Society, Choir, Band, Orchestra and many others. We have over 30 clubs in our school which is impressive. The administration is very supportive of all clubs, sports, and organizations. They always accommodate for all the activities going on. It's also great that teachers are willing to become advisors for clubs and sports.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

The school had a no bullying policy that was enforced, but would still do nothing towards people who weren't outwardly bullied. The diversity of the school is mainly one sided, being one of the 5 African American students in my graduating class. The school had next to nothing in terms of sports, we didn't have a football team because our football field was too small, and the clubs and sports received next to no funding. Our Health class was just a combination with our Advisory, which meant we learned next to nothing in the class.

I thank CSI High School tremendously for all the vital skills.', 'It’s a really big schol. I wish there was more student involvement but overall it’s not a bad college.', ""I am a senior in College of Staten Island. I started my college life since 2014 as a freshmen. I learned a lot in college and I make many good friends in college, too. It's a good place to study and get professional knowledge, it prepares you to the real society."", 'C.S.I.H.S has been an incredible school these past four years. Overall the teachers are great and are willing to help in the morning, during lunch, and sometimes after class. The facilities are modern as the school is still a fairly young one. However, I would say that the resources have been the greatest part of C.S.I. There have been many scholarships and various programs fostered by this school that have allowed to me learn so much outside of the class room and even given me the chance to go abroad, as well as participate in a student exchange program! It is fair to say that CSI is among the best high schools in Staten Island.', 'The College of Staten Island High School for International Studies is a great School. The faculty and staff help students reach their full potential. There is a sense of family with small group sessions each day and a small class size.', 'What I love about my school is it’s diversity and feeling of family. I was thrilled when my name was picked by lottery to attend. This new facility was filled with proud students and a loving staff. Each grade only had about 130 students making it a very intimate learning environment.    During the summer of my soon to be junior year I was going through some emotional issues. My mother and I decided to switch me to a school closer to home thinking it would benefit me to not travel for a long period twice a day. In summary it was the worst decision . My mother wrote a letter to my previous principal asking for me to return in January and admitting the hasty decision she had made.     Even though unheard of I was invited back. I felt reunited with family! I learned to seek help in my school and not be shy about it and it’s helped .      CSI High School for International Studies is a phenomenal school . I feel ready for college educationally and socially. I also feel very loved!', 'I liked that the school was small because I knew all of my teachers and it felt more personal and helpful.', ""I was able to build and grow a relationship with one of the career advisors including a few of my professors. The school contains a comfortable environment for me both as a minority and a female. The school also offers various opportunities to join into multiple groups depending on a student's interest, as well as academic opportunities for continuing one's education."", 'I liked that the school is very international and gives the opportunity to learn Chinese as well as Spanish. However, a change that I would like to see is that students that participate in sports should be allowed to take sport gym such as track gym.', ""CSI High School for International Studies is  school that I recommend for all. Everyday having waken up by the daily announcements, my principal always emphasizes CSI's foundation of community, empathy and pluralism. It wouldn't be wrong to say however that CSI follows all of these accordingly, with it's overarching international influence and aim for college career readiness. Although if I had to commend CSI, it would have to be it's focus on the students as seen by our growing sports club (track/volleyball) and the availability for students to create their own club. With an amazing history of staff and being a small school, CSI is a family in it's own right."", 'My experience at CSI High school was fairly well, i was able to learn the japanese language, and also travel to japan with the school. the environment is friendly, but sometimes too small.', ""As a previous Alum, I enjoyed my time as as a student, even if my overall view of the school isn't negative, I can't say I have very much of a positive outlook on CSIHSIS, the teachers were enjoyable but the overall environment of the school was very fake. The school had a no bullying policy that was enforced, but would still do nothing towards people who weren't outwardly bullied. The diversity of the school is mainly one sided, being one of the 5 African American students in my graduating class. The school had next to nothing in terms of sports, we didn't have a football team because our football field was too small, and the clubs and sports received next to no funding. Our Health class was just a combination with our Advisory, which meant we learned next to nothing in the class. But I can say that the School spirit of the School was very high considering the Spirit week activities and overall CSIHS was an OK school to go to.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

I would like to see them provide more resources to help assist students in finding colleges and scholarships.', 'Most parts of the school are very good. Some teachers clearly are not cut out for teaching, though, with some not being able to handle even a small class, and some clearly not even knowing the topics they are teaching. This is a very limited number of teachers though. I have only experienced 2 such teachers in my career in high school', 'Academics wise the school is not bad. The people are not pleasant. There is no school  spirit and students have no freedom it is basically a day care.', 'Kinnelon is a place of learning and competition. Here in our little bubble, we like to support the sports teams, participate in clubs/activities, and learn. it really is a great place.', 'I saw on some other reviews ""a few bad teachers do a lot of damage"" and ""school nurse is never there"" - both true.  The math and science classes have mostly mediocre if not incompetent teachers - yet the administration gives them tenure.', 'I like Kinnelon. It has great teachers and the teachers work well and help other students so they can succeed. I would change how the schedule works and that Juniors and Seniors should be allowed to leave lunch for school.', ""It is a good school with some great teachers but some of the teachers are really bad!!  The administration doesn't care."", 'Teachers here are amazing. They care about each and every one of their students. A lot of teachers here have their masters degrees and/or doctorate degrees. Multiple teachers have impacted me in a positive way and have really set me up to succeed in the future. Not only do teachers here teach great academically speaking but great life lessons and values. The scheduling process if very easy and counselors are very easy to get in contact with if you have a scheduling conflict or just need to change out of some classes. The workload reasonable. I would say that the workload falls on the student not the teacher. You definitely learn time management here at KHS. KHS offers student/peer study services, almost all teachers have one day a week where they stay after if you need help and have questions. A popular class among seniors is Psychology  because its a course offered through Syracuse University. If you get a high enough grade you can pay to get college credits and be a step ahead.', ""Although KHS is not very diverse we do have minorities here. Kids and staff are always extremely welcoming and never give others a hard time. No one even focuses on race. It's never discussed as an issue and students don't care about it. For example, if an African American or someone of the Asian decent comes to KHS no one says anything mean or even really thinks twice about it. Students at KHS are cultured and are not racist or predjudice at all. Everyone is very accepting and I would say that there are no challenges with that. Students are very involved with school. Peer pressure is non existent here. Here in Kinnelon, since Kindergarten we are taught about acceptance, responsibility, respect, and to not pressure your peers. Bullying is also non existent here. We have no bullies and are taught since Kindergarten also many full values. As for sexual orientation, everyone just goes with the flow. I know it sounds corny or too good to be true but seriously everyone is very accepting."", 'There is a very diverse and wide variety of extracurricular opportunities at KHS. Most clubs require a decent amount of commitment. Some of the most popular clubs are Future Business Leaders of America, Social Outreach Club, Peer Mentors, Varsity Club, Quidditch Club etc. Staff within the school run the clubs and really devote their time and heart to it. There is a club for almost everything here.', ""Overall Kinnelon High School has made me grow an immense amount and I thank every teacher and staff member that has helped me along the way. Teachers here really do go the extra mile for you because they genuinely care about their students education. Academically speaking, Kinnelon High School is the best of the best. We were ranked #3 out of the state! Sports here are awesome too! If you want your child to get noticed..Kinnelon is the place to be. School always feels very safe and recently KHS has stepped it up with security which is a good feeling. It always feels like a safe and happy environment. There is an immense amount of clubs and extra-curricular activities for everyone. From Future Business Leaders of America to Quiddich Club. KHS really does have it all. I don't think I could be happier with the education I have received from this amazing school truly. Every Fall we have a drama and every spring we have a musical. They always turn out great! Kinnelon is on the smaller side and I know every single person in my graduating class. Some may argue that that's a bad thing but not me. Its awesome getting to know a diverse group of kids. Overall, I love it and I highly recommend this school to anyone looking for something close to perfection."", 'Anti-bullying is huge, security has been increased immensely in the past couple of years.  There is no police-specific force.', 'They are great.  Plenty of options for students to become involved in.', ""I would 100% without a doubt choose this school again. It's completely changed me in every single way. I've become this brand new person who is strong, confident, intelligent, and a leader. I've become my own person who is only influenced by the goodness of the world and the goodness in people. I'm not the classic teenager that hates their family. I don't do drugs. I don't get drunk and I definitely don't associate myself with people who do. I've become nothing but efficient in everything I do. Without this school and the experiences I had within its walls, I would no the the person i am today."", ""Obviously no school is perfect. There are plenty of teacher I didn't like, but there are plenty more that I loved. The thing about the good teachers here is that they're not just better than the bad teachers. They're the most intelligent, passionate, interesting, caring people I have ever had the honor of meeting. You can make connections with teachers here that I hope will last a lifetime."", 'The school offers a variety of activities for students and is extremely spirited in everything. From involvement in athletics, the arts, community service, or simply academics, students can find any activity they would like to become more involved in at the school.  The environment is great overall, and everyone pushes you to be your best in anything you do.', 'The teachers at this school go above and beyond in everything they have to do.  They truly care about the students and their well-beings, the quality of their work, and how they learn.  They personalize their lessons for their classes and make each class engaging and intriguing for the students.  Though many teachers vary in their teaching styles, students are able to get a lot out of each class.  All teachers are extremely knowledgeable in their respective subjects.', ""There are some teachers who are in it for the final bell and the paycheck at the end of the week, but my experience with academics has been overwhelmingly positive. Most of my teachers really love what they're teaching and want students to excel in their courses. I've even had teachers who will email me back in thirty seconds at 10pm in response to a homework question. The workload can be stressful if you choose challenging courses, but your schedule is your decision."", 'Kinnelon High School is limited in diversity. Something like 95% of students are white. Most are upper-middle or plain upper-class, and there is a disproportionate amount of Catholic students. On the LGTQ spectrum, there are few cases of discrimination, although there are some jerks. I have seen ""Meninist"" shirts on male students and mild sexism in the classroom. In terms of peer pressure, I have experienced very little, but it\'s up to whom you\'re involved with.', 'Good people, a few bad teachers do a lot of damage.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

However, there are definitely some teachers that should just not be allowed to teach.', 'I graduated from Edison High School in 2017. I can say that majority of the teachers here really care about the students and helping them no matter what. They are very involved, friendly, and productive. More so, the school really stressed college readiness very well. By my senior year, there were two college centers, college counselors, and so many more resources given to us. We had macbooks, all the textbooks we needed, and a media center filled with computers (which was once the library). Not to mention there were tons of after school clubs and activities to partake in. Edison High School was overall a very good experience for me.', 'The school tries hard to connect with its students and promote a greater desire for learning. The failings come from the lack of connection it actually has, where the rules and organizing of curriculum is out of touch with what students actually need to thrive.', ""What's great about Edison High. The school is completely diverse, not only do we have great teachers, but we have exceptional students who go to this school and we already have many students getting accepted into college. In my experience at Edison High School, I did not just get a great learning experience, but I also made many friends with students and teachers and each year gets more fun."", 'Ever since I stepped into the doors of Edison High School, I could already tell it was going to be a warm and welcoming environment.

I, as a high school senior now, look back at my high school experience, I can say it is very well-rounded. Edison High School allowed me an opportunity to explore my interests while introducing me to new programs and activities, ideologies, and ways of thinking to elevate my chances at a brighter future as well as a promising today. Even though my high school is by no means perfect, my experience is going to be a stepping stone I can rely on as I enter college and my profession.', 'My experience with Edison High School was rather well. The majority of teachers there were great resulting in high academic grades with nearly half the school on the honor roll each marking period. My only suggestions are I feel that there is a necessity of more social activities to engage students. There were a few amount out dances, school trips, or club activities. Fundraisers would be a substantial   way to help raise money for more school events and renovations.', ""My experience at Edison High school was generally pretty cool. I myself took higher level classes and was involved im The soccer program there. Im thankful that I got the chance to be a student at Edison High mostly because of how diverse the school is. There are so many different things to do there and so many different people that go to school there. I feel like it helped me understand the world more because in the world one is bound to face various different people , and dealing with these people of different races and experiences, I feel , would assist me later on in the future.

Growing up in Edison, it is a very safe town and sometimes that is taken for granted. People can just walk into the school with very little speculation, which is scary in today's society. The school does a good job academically and when it comes to sports and clubs. For the most part, the teachers are good influences both in and out of the classroom. The environment is very diverse and people are very accepting of each other and their differences. The food is a typical school lunch, with its pluses and its minuses. When extra help is needed, there are numerous ways to get help through after school tutoring, extra help from teachers and clubs from within the school."", ""What I like about Edison high school is how friendly the staff are and their high regard for the student's education."", 'Edison High School was a great environment and learning experience. The teachers did their best to help each student succeed.', ""From my years of attending Edison High School, one of the many things that really appealed to me was the generosity of the teachers. Before moving to New Jersey, not many teachers from my old school were as willing to help children compared to the teachers that were offered at Edison High School.  As of now,  I'm a senior, I have learned so much life lessons from great teachers such as Mr.Nasser and Mrs.Mitchell. Not only do the teachers try to better our academic performance but they also help to teach us life lessons. When I first walked into Edison High School, I was a lost boy, however, through my experiences over these past years, I have learned what reality was.  One thing that can be improved is the respect that some students have to show to one another. It seems as if a few students are not cooperative as others."", 'Overall i enjoyed this school.

However, I went to the principal and he moved me up because he wanted me to challenge myself. Edison High School is all about challenging yourself, which I had the opportunity to do. Even though the class is hard, I try my hardest to succeed. The teachers are also willing to help students whenever they need. They don't mind staying after school or before school if it help us.

Finding the right teacher can mean several other opportunities both in and out of school. There are many nearby academic programs and extracurriculars to become involved in.

The teachers at FPM are really helpful and understandable. They will help you in every possible way they can just to be sure you understand a lesson. If they know that a lesson is hard, they will take more than a day just to go over a lesson by explaining it through videos and games to make it fun as well as educational.

The social environment is great, but an area that lacks is the education of non-AP students. In advanced classes, the workload was demanding and the environment was serious. Regular classes were treated more as a joke. The classes felt laid-back and the students were apathetic about their work. A large portion of this was the teachers fault. It seemed that most didn't try to teach as enthusiastically as the advanced teachers, giving regular classes an overall lazy feel.

Frank Sinatra School of the Arts High School,"['I am a drama major, and have auditioned for and performed in three of the major musicals.  The school is beautiful, and we have a ""Broadway-like"" theater on the main level called the Tony Bennett Concert Hall.  The school is very safe, and you are free to express yourself; if a student is gay or transgender, they are welcome and not bullied.  We have many opportunities to explore the arts and see Broadway shows.  The neighborhood that the school is in, Astoria, Queens, is very cool and has a lot of restaurants and Kaufman Studios.  I have made friends with students that live in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as kids comes from different parts of NYC to attend FSSA.  Because the school is small, you get a lot of attention, and everyone knows you.', ""Overall, I had a great experience going to Frank Sinatra. The school arts programs are many and diverse allowing everyone to learn about and express their passions in the arts. The academics in the school are also fairly good, and there are many very great teachers that you can talk to, not just about academics but personal life as well. You don't feel like a robot working for a boss, but rather you feel like you have a companion that is there to assist you and help you achieve your goals. The sports teams could be a little more diverse because there are many girls teams, but not as many boys teams. I am currently the captain of the boys basketball team in the school, and I would love to see some more teams available such as volleyball and football as there is definitely an interest from students."", 'Frank Sinatra School of the Arts is a gem of a school. The school was founded by Tony Bennett with the idea of providing students from all backgrounds an amazing opportunity to hone their craft; whether that be in film, music, dance and art. My son has thrived at this school as a film major. He learned the foundation of cinematography with college-type classes, and created films ranging from PSAs, film noirs, horror and documentaries. In addition, he was able to take many challenging AP classes; ranging from AP World and US History to AP Bio and more. The teachers truly care about their students at this school. They are dedicated to making sure that all the kids succeed. In addition, the physical plant is beautiful, with an amazing concert hall, spacious studios to dance or paint and inviting classrooms. It’s a public school with a private school look and feel. Students are able to work in an environment that is both beautiful and inviting.', ""FSSA in my opinion is the best performing arts high school in NYC. Our principal, Gideon Franke, is both incredibly kind and great at his job, as are his VP's, Deans. etc. He makes learning, arts, and communication large priorities.

Whippany Park High School,"[""Whippany Park has like another home to me for the past four years.

I've met a lot of good people here and I will cherish the memories that we made together forever."", 'I have had a positive experience and most teachers have been very helpful.  The academics are rigorous when you take honors and AP courses and present a challenge.  There are also many student organizations to be a part of and football games are a large social event.  The student body is relatively supportive and is small enough that the school is tight knit and you don’t see a new face everyday.  The campus is easy to navigate.  However, since it is such a small school, classes can be cut or moved to its sister school is attendance is low so that is an inconvenience.', 'Overall, WPHS is a typical suburban New Jersey school. Among all the teachers (who are mostly decent), there are a few excellent teachers, and the student culture seemed generally neutral. In terms of preparing students for college, those in higher-level classes (APs and Honors) are mostly well-prepared in terms of workload and curriculum. I personally liked that there was more student choice in what classes students take (compared to other schools), but one specific thing that could change is the placement of the required Personal Finance class - senior year, rather than freshman year, should be when students take it so that they are better-equipped for the financial hurdles brought on by college.', 'Whippany Park was a small, overall mediocre school. Not because everything was mediocre, but rather there was such a wide range. There were great teachers, horrible ones, excellent sports, terrible sports, and some extraordinarily well funded clubs versus hardly-existing ones.', 'Great overall experience. Definitely prepares you for colleges and getting accepted. It would be helpful if the classes helped with the SAT & the ACT instead of having to pay a private tutor.', 'I enjoyed my years at WPHS. As much as I am ready to start my college life I am sad to leave here. My Teachers have been awesome they go out of their way to be helpful and making us comfortable during these sometimes uncomfortable years.  I am a varsity cheerleader and have been cheering for WP for all 4 years of high school. I have enjoyed being part of a group with these great girls.', ""Whippany Park High School is a terrific school .  There is not much diversity but that is not the school's fault.  That is due to the fact of who resides in the town obviously. I do feel very safe in high school and nowadays, not everyone feels that way sadly.   I feel my high school has prepared me very well for college by offering many challenging rigorous classes.  We do not do well in sports but that is not important to me as I am not very athletic, although I was captain of the Cheerleading squad.    I am going to truly miss being here but am looking forward to my academic future,  which will hopefully be at Villanova University.  l just need some financial help ."", ""My experience has been a good one. I have made many friends and learned so many valuable life lessons throughout my four years here. If I could live it all over again, I would in a heartbeat. I've made so many memories and life long relationships. Whippany Park High School is an amazing school that teaches so many valuable lessons. It's my home away from home."", 'I love the family atmosphere that Whippany Park provides. The teachers and Staff have genuine interest in the students and want to see them succeed in life. Lots of clubs and sports help build the student body into a strong community where people lift eachother up. Being in a school that is so accepting makes me want to bring that atmosphere to whichever college I decide to go to. Safety for everyone is very important in the school and the administration is always thinking of even better ways to keep the school safe.', 'I love my teachers. When I was a freshman I was very worried but now I love it. I liked how the changed the food company but they could still use some different options.', 'Whippany park offers classes that any other high school would. I rate it a four because I felt that it was easy to make friends and the classes that I took were worth it for the most part as they were challenging and interesting. Some teachers I feel should be looked at again but overall the experience was memorable.', ""It's a great school. The teachers will help you achieve your goals and teach you a lot, as long as you put in the effort to learn and be a good student yourself.  The guidance department is pretty good as well but the student must take initiative if they want guidance to do something for them. Otherwise, the guidance department isn't really that helpful; the student must reach out if they want something but if they do, then the counselors are usually helpful. The school isn't that diverse, but it is very including and accepting of everyone. There are many clubs and activities, and if a student wants a new club, they can start a club very easily because students and teachers are open to new ideas."", 'Whippany Park High School has gone through many changes over the last few years. For example, the school has gotten new staff and equipment. The biggest change over the last few years is the new principal, Mr. Kelly. Mr. Kelly has brought change to the high school for better or worse. Mr. Kelly\'s goal is to create a friendly atmosphere within the school, where students and staff members support each other. The school has shown its endeavor to creating this atmosphere by having the phrase, ""we are family"" hung up on one of the main entrances. The school has a positive atmosphere even though some students are always complaining.', 'Whippany was a small high school.  Good athletics and a great music program.  The history and english department teachers were decent the math and science departments were as good.  Overall I had a great experience. Made some great friends there and had some teachers who I will remember for a lifetime.  I was in band and did both winter and spring track.  I also did yearbook club.  The band directors are some of the best people I have ever met in my life, and they really make band great.  The band takes a trip every two years and even though its usually considered nerdy to be in band, a quarter of the school was in it when I was in high school.', 'It is a very small school where everyone knows each other.  It will certainly get you ready for college with its high academic standards, but it would be nice to have more class offerings.  Since it is so small, there are not enough students to take certain classes, so they do not run.', 'Some teachers are very good while others grasp for materials from everywhere making it very hard to focus and learn concepts. The school is generally very small which makes it easy for cliques to form and gossip to spread. The administration has recently become very involved with students experiences and have helped to quell some harassment that has formerly gone on at the school. There is a lot of school spirit shown at the football and hockey games, school spirit week, school dances, and the pep rally.', 'The school has its ups and downs. Some teachers are fantastic and can actually teach; some cannot. The clubs are good and some of the sports are nice too. However, the student body of WP is actually horrible.', 'While a small school, its definitely a great learning environment. There are many teachers, especially the older ones, that really understand how students work. They also have a great array of extra curricular activities like the theater department, track and field, and the best one- the Marching band!', 'I like the atmosphere around the school.

The student body is relatively supportive and is small enough that the school is tight knit and you don’t see a new face everyday.  The campus is easy to navigate.  However, since it is such a small school, classes can be cut or moved to its sister school is attendance is low so that is an inconvenience.', 'Overall, WPHS is a typical suburban New Jersey school. Among all the teachers (who are mostly decent), there are a few excellent teachers, and the student culture seemed generally neutral. In terms of preparing students for college, those in higher-level classes (APs and Honors) are mostly well-prepared in terms of workload and curriculum. I personally liked that there was more student choice in what classes students take (compared to other schools), but one specific thing that could change is the placement of the required Personal Finance class - senior year, rather than freshman year, should be when students take it so that they are better-equipped for the financial hurdles brought on by college.', 'Whippany Park was a small, overall mediocre school. Not because everything was mediocre, but rather there was such a wide range.

That is due to the fact of who resides in the town obviously. I do feel very safe in high school and nowadays, not everyone feels that way sadly.   I feel my high school has prepared me very well for college by offering many challenging rigorous classes.  We do not do well in sports but that is not important to me as I am not very athletic, although I was captain of the Cheerleading squad.    I am going to truly miss being here but am looking forward to my academic future,  which will hopefully be at Villanova University.  l just need some financial help ."", ""My experience has been a good one.

The teachers will help you achieve your goals and teach you a lot, as long as you put in the effort to learn and be a good student yourself.  The guidance department is pretty good as well but the student must take initiative if they want guidance to do something for them. Otherwise, the guidance department isn't really that helpful; the student must reach out if they want something but if they do, then the counselors are usually helpful. The school isn't that diverse, but it is very including and accepting of everyone. There are many clubs and activities, and if a student wants a new club, they can start a club very easily because students and teachers are open to new ideas."", 'Whippany Park High School has gone through many changes over the last few years. For example, the school has gotten new staff and equipment. The biggest change over the last few years is the new principal, Mr. Kelly. Mr. Kelly has brought change to the high school for better or worse. Mr. Kelly\'s goal is to create a friendly atmosphere within the school, where students and staff members support each other. The school has shown its endeavor to creating this atmosphere by having the phrase, ""we are family"" hung up on one of the main entrances. The school has a positive atmosphere even though some students are always complaining.', 'Whippany was a small high school.  Good athletics and a great music program.  The history and english department teachers were decent the math and science departments were as good.  Overall I had a great experience.

There is a lot of school spirit shown at the football and hockey games, school spirit week, school dances, and the pep rally.', 'The school has its ups and downs. Some teachers are fantastic and can actually teach; some cannot. The clubs are good and some of the sports are nice too. However, the student body of WP is actually horrible.', 'While a small school, its definitely a great learning environment.

Accordingly, the options for classes (outside of STEM) are slim, and social opportunities are even slimmer. Luckily, I had a good friend group to make it through high school with. Not everyone here is as fortunate. There is an intense focus on academics, with students competing and pushing each other further constantly. This can be both good and bad.

Clubs usually meet once per week, sometimes twice if an activity they are running is comping up.

For instance, the district tried to pass a bond a few years ago, and numerous parents complained because their taxes went up $500 a year.  It does seem a bit hefty, but that was because it was an expensive bond that would improve the school's condition tremendously.  The school itself definitely needs some revamping and construction.

Division Avenue Senior High School,"['I still attend Division Ave and so far as a sophomore I would say I had a great experience. Last year I learned many valuable skills that I could see myself using for the rest of my life. I struggled in math last year and because of the wonderful teachers and resources that are provided at my school I improved. Now I use these skills in all of my classes this year. I really feel safe due to the security in my school. Overall, I know that I will become successful at the end of high school because of what Division had to offer.', 'I liked the effort the teachers put in. They were amazing and prepared me to move on with my schooling.', 'My experience at Division Avenue High School was extremely positive. I am certain that no other place exists that can provide students with an outstanding support system from both the staff and fellow students.', 'Overall the school is pretty good. It is small so there is a strong sense of community. Most of the teachers are pretty good and care about what they teach', ""I love Division Ave High School. The teachers are great and always ready to help in any way. I love my school's motto :"", ""I went to the school for all 4 years of high school and graduated in 2017. It was a normal high school experience with bulling and all. The school never did anything to help me being bullied my sophomore year but that's expected since the administration was too busy confiscating phones to care. The only thing that made me really enjoy going to school everyday was the musicals, the marching band, and the music and art classes."", 'Overall, I had a lot of fun. I have some of the best memories of my life there. Now that I’m in my first year of college, I do miss it. But, I don’t want to go back. I had amazing teachers who taught me life lessons, and amazing friends. There was some drama, but it was stupid.', 'I like our school, we have relatively good teachers and a variety of programs/classes to choose from, including AP classes. We have a wide variety of clubs and after school activities in which anyone can take part of. The only critique I have is the new security measures that are a little obtrusive when trying to enter the building.', 'At Division Avenue there are so many extra cirrucular opportunities. The sports and clubs are very good. I have joined cheerleading, chefs club, key club, and badminton. My experiences with these clubs/sports were so fun and I enjoyed making new friends on the way. As I hit my junior year my guidance counselor told me about a program called GC Tech. The program was like a trade school that juniors and seniors attend half of the day and is 100% free. They had many choices of classes to choice from like Cosmetology, Culinary, Medical, Electrical, Auto, ETC. I decided to join it and chose to do cosmetology and ever since then I have improved so much in that field and at the end of senior year will be getting my license.

The sports have a bond within the team that is opened up to everyone who steps foot on the field. The teams I was apart of are very active in helping the youth and growing the programs.

The school provides lots of opportunities to take college level classrooms, but the closeness between the students and their teachers makes it easier for them to achieve higher grades.', ""I loved going to high school here, the teachers are super involved and always accessible. They push you to do better and try to better grades, the one downside to the school is that it's so small everyone knows each other's business and the parents can get involved in the smallest things."", 'At my time as a student at Carle Place High School, I had a great time. I meant super friendly people and created bonds that will hopefully last a lifetime. I learned how to manage time and be responsible for my duties as a person and a student. I had an amazing time as a three sport athlete in football, basketball, and track&field. The culture here is great with students striving for excellence to them coming out and supporting sports teams.', ""Because the town and school is so small, the entire place is a bubble. I found that it was a very cliquish town and th eonly people who enjoyed high school were the ones who were 'in'. Because of the small population, that does pertain to most people, but excludes a small few. The academics at the school are great, and every teacher is very accomodating and helpful. My favorite part was the designated extra help period at the end of the day where you could talk to teachers, ask for help, or makeup tests. This was extremely helpful and definitely something other schools should consider, because it is very beneficial to the students. Overall, the school is very good academically, but too small and dramatic for an excellent time."", ""The first time I step a foot at Carle Place High school it was when I was about twelve years old. I was very scared and didn't wanted to go. Because it was my first year in the U.S and I didn't spoke any english, I thought that I was never going to have friends, learned english and that everyone was going to look at me weird however it was the opposite. Since that day I learned that at Carle Place everyone is a family there and teachers are always there for you no matter what."", 'Carle Place High School did a very good job of preparing me for the next level of my education because it offered many classes at higher, college levels.

From choosing the right schools to apply to, the application process, giving me and my family all the information and tools we needed for financial aid and the academics are everything you could want from a top school district.  I have made connections with many of my teachers who helped me with recommendation letters and guidance.  I couldn't have asked fro a better HS experience that prepared me for the next phase of my academic life."", ""I was born and raised in Carle Place. I've attended the Carle Place school district since kindergarten, and it is where I have met all of my best friends. We are a very small town, and a very small school. Therefore, we treat each other like family. I love being able to recognize and say hello to every face I see in the hallways. We always come together for causes both inside and outside of our community. We take part in fundraisers, charity events, and raise awareness for so many causes. This school is very altruistic and public-spirited, which is what I love so much about it. When you're in Carle Place, you are home."", ""It's obvious that most kids drink or smoke, teachers even occasionally poke fun at whoever is currently the school weed dealer. Huge parties are often busted, but only the popular kids get invited anyway. Our security system involves a young, 5' tall female teacher sitting at the front desk during her off periods and watching people come into the school. Pretty much anyone could kill us all at any time."", ""There are a lot of things to do, but only a few get publicity.

I also think that Morristown is incredibly diverse, with many people representing all ethnicities and cultures. This is important for a melting pot of ideas in a learning environment. A few points of improvement would be the physical high school itself, which is a bit outdated. Many of the classes do not have A/C in the spring and classes get very hot.

Over my years, Morristown has made many changes, including various security changes. These changes have made me feel safer as a student, however have taken away many of the freedoms students had previously enjoyed.

However with Elizabeth High school comes a lot of stress, within this school you have a lot of teachers who give out a lot of work without taking in to consideration that you have other classes and assignments. In addition, if you are expecting high school to be like a movie... its not . Elizabeth high school doesn't hold any events and every and any event that they do hold you have to pay to enter, which I feel as though isn't fair . In addition Elizabeth high school that focus on the arts as they prioritize academics, however the art classes and the  art teachers are the best classes and people you could ever meet. With that being said, Elizabeth High school will be an experience that i will never forget  for it was a place where I made many memories."", ""I loved my experience at Elizabeth High School! I attended Upper Academy which is now known as Frank J Cicarell. It was very diverse, the teachers really care about the students, they offer tons of extracurricular activities and it's just a really inviting and productive learning environment."", ""Elizabeth High School stresses the importance of academics on all their students. They make sure teachers are giving college-level work which in turn preps students for college. Unfortunately, they may stress academics more than they should. Many students try to balance work, school, and their responsibilities at home. On a positive note, EHS provides their students with laptops to do their work. The school I attend is clean and the security and janitorial staff are both friendly and helpful. Some teachers abuse their authority but for the most part, our teachers really care about our near future. Our guidance counselors connect us with college fairs and scholarship opportunities. Our principal and vice-principal stress the importance of looking college-ready as much as being college-ready. Our uniforms aid in making us look professional. Living in an urban school district, I'm proud to go to a school where the staff cares about me and pushes me to be better than my current self."", ""You'll learn to joke around about the school's budget and what's missing, but you'll know that great teachers and fun isn't what's missing."", 'It was a very challenging school where we were being prepared for college since day one of attending.Although there were some flaws due to adjusting to the new building it was a great experience.Im glad to have attended EHS', 'I like the fact that Elizabeth public schools make sure all their students are prepared for life after school and overall success as an adult', ""My experience at Elizabeth High school has been good and the sports here are amazing. The teachers are good and very helpful when you need it. They provide tutoring programs for you and extra help from students. Students usually get along well at this school and they treat each other with respect as well as they do with the teachers. They provide AVID at the school which stands for Advance Via Individual Determination and it is a great way to help you get prepared for college. Also, they have college visits they we go on within the state so they we can gather more information about more then just one college that we want to go to. The sports programs here are good and the coaching staffs of all the sports are good coaches and they are supportive throughout your whole time with them playing the sport.

Over the last 3 years, I am now able to say that all my teachers have successfully prepared me for my college courses this fall. Not only did the classes require a lot of work, but there was also so much going around the school such as clubs meetings, bake sales, and even tutoring. No one can say it is a dangerous or uncomfortable situation at the school. Everyone always seems to get along extremely well. There is never any altercations between students or teachers.

This is to both the school faculty & the students themselves. GPAs & rankings are constantly being compared, even just in one's spare time. Students will usually take 2-3 AP classes per year. In this school, the music program is a big thing. Marching band probably has the most spirit out of everyone else. Some cool features are the black box theatre (auditorium) & dark room (for photography), which came along with the brand new building we received two years ago. At EHS, there is no bullying. I have never witnessed our heard of anyone being bullied during my time here. Though many have bad attitudes, there are kids of all sorts and you should be able to find your people & form friendships with no problem."", ""How could I complain when we got an entire new building?

When there was a tragedy in the school, everyone came together as the family that we were.

The South environment really balances a stable work pattern with just enough difficulty to get you where you need to be but most of the faculty is relaxed enough where class doesn't feel like a prison and you look forward to it sometimes.

The school has amazing academics and arts programs as well as a multitude of clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities to choose to participate in. I was a member of the school's track team and the Italian Club. I was the captain of the Italian club this past year and participated int he schools International Festival performance. in addition, Wagner offers a lot of resources that get us ready for our college experience and future plans. Overall, I believe that Wagner is a wonderful place to spend your high school career and obtain a great education before college, while being in a safe, fun, environment with good people."", 'My experience has been very fun so far. All good things come to an end so what I would love for a change in college is meeting new people and exploring different cultures in sites I’ve never been to.', 'Attending Susan E. Wagner in the fall of 2016, I was very enthusiastic about the upcoming International Festival. It involves cultures from around the world, and clubs coming together to perform and demonstrate what make this county its wonderful meeting pot. There’s also a great theatre and art program at Wagner that prepares their students for college performance and visual art. The Scholars Program is ready excelling, and many other academies. Although Wagner is pretty great, there can also be improvements, such as the way we are spending our money, but we als just became a specialized school s good things are approaching us soon.', 'Susan E Wagner was a decent experience. Alot of the teachers are very helpful and professional but the systems and students are by far one of the downfalls.', 'Susan E Wagner High School is a very professional school that always takes into consideration the students feelings and ideas. This school is not only diverse but it also shows students that they should embrace who they are without the need to feel scared of others opinions. The teachers are very helpful when it comes to a student being successful.', 'I love Susan E. Wagner High School and I will deeply miss it when I graduate. The teachers, faculty and students you will meet and the ones that you will never forget. You will always have someone by your side every step of the way and the best support you can ask for.', ""Susan E. Wagner is a place that attracts diversity. There are kids from all over the world. This is evident from all the clubs we have and the annual International festival we hold every year. Individuals of shared customs come together and show the audience their traditions. The administration has gradually excelled each year as students receive updates more frequently and are aware of what's going on within their educational vicinity. Although Wagner prospers majority of the time, I would like to see some improvements. For instance, the bathrooms need to get renovated because students don't feel comfortable using it due to its lack of maintenance. Furthermore, I feel that the school should expand their options of Advanced Placement classes. I wanted to take an AP Italian and an AP Business class, but none were offered. The school can't be perfect, but the faculty definitely tries their hardest to make it better than it was yesterday."", 'Susan E. Wagner High School has yet to fail to challenge my perspectives. Wagner is so great because it cannot be labeled as just a performing arts school, or just an athletic school, or just an advanced intelligence school. Wagner covers all of those bases. Wagner is extremely diverse, in its opportunities, areas of specialty and in the population. I would definitely recommend Wagner to anyone and everyone.  If you are the quiet kid, there are clubs to join to fit your interests in an environment that is a tight nit group of like minded people. If you are the outgoing kid, there is student government, sports teams, and clubs to expand your horizon and surpass your limits. Wagner gives every kid every chance they can get to step a little out of their comfort zone to prepare for college, as well as get to there dream. Wagner helped me lay out a strong foundation of education, life lessons, dedicated teachers and lifelong friends.', 'What I enjoyed most about Susan E. Wagner High School was the school culture and clubs and activities that were provided.', ""Overall, I feel that Wagner is a friendly environment with a very diverse group of students. Throughout the years, I've only came across teachers that have helped me grow tremendously as a person and to become the student I am today. However, the only thing I would want to change is the size of the school. There are way too many students at Wagner and there isn't much room in the hallways but other then that it is a very good school."", ""I loved the inclusiveness of the different majors. I'm a theatre major at Wagner and have been involved in every production put on the main stage as well as our senior musical Addams Family. I have had some hard times with academics but I have always found my way back into the 90's and passing classes with flying colors due to the amazing tutoring sessions held at Wagner."", 'Throughout my four years at Susan E. Wagner High School I’ve been involved in various cultural celebrations, mainly our annual International Festival. Which is where students can come together to show their diversity and unity. I have also been the president of an after school community service club known as Loving Bones. This club has taught me many things about being a leader and what it meant to contribute to a cause. The organization we worked with in this club was the March of Dimes. Working with the March of Dimes has helped me define my role in society by enabling me to be motivated to accomplish my goals. Overall my experience at Susan E. Wagner High School has been a rewarding one and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.', 'Wagner highschool was an excellent school for it. i had great friends and teachers that helped me get through high school. The atmosphere was nice and it was a very clean school. The only thing they could improve on is getting students more involved in extracurricular activities.', 'Susan E Wagner is always clean. The staff here works hard keeping the halls and the classrooms clean and we can tell! Also we recently built a music and performing arts building. It is so modern and nice. I feel privileged to be taking a class in there!', 'Though I am leaving Susan E. Wagner in a couple of months, it has provided me with a great education and a wonderful student environment to be immersed in. Being apart of the Scholars Academy made me strive to do the best I possibly could everyday. The Scholars Academy helped me build my integrity, hardworking attitude and has prepared me for college. The memories I have with the Wind Ensemble and Jazz Band are certainly special and can never be experienced anywhere else in New York City. As for Wagner having a phenomenal performing arts program, there is an overwhelming negative to the school. I do wish to see the Guidance Wing change. I find it ominous and I do not feel welcomed to express myself if something is wrong. Overall the school gave me four years of love, and has prepared me for college.', 'Susan E Wagner has a wide variety of courses and academies. I am in the Science Academy and I love it because of the great teachers and opportunities available to me. It is a very diverse school with so many culturally based clubs and an International festival celebrating our diversity. There are also many other clubs, more than 60 clubs, from Anime club to Robotics club. There are also many sports, including many sports for girls only, such as football, softball, and badminton.', 'There was a variety of opportunities for students to become involved in school or extracurricular activities. Most teachers were approachable and willing to help students.', 'I love the fact that its a school that puts in the effort in the way they present themselves and keeps students feeling comfortable especially with the great school spirit.', 'The teachers connect with their students and teach them according to their learning styles. Spending all these years in Wagner creates a special bond .']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

This benefited me greatly as I improved my time management and cut down on my procrastination. The only thing I do not enjoy about this school is their food at times and the cramped hallways in one building that makes it difficult to get to class on time. Other than that, my four years spent here have been decent with few complaints.', ""I feel lucky to have gone to Piscataway High School. Not only is its student body diverse in terms of race, religion, sexuality, etc. but also in thought. There are excellent teachers and an array of extracurricular activities available to students.

I'd like to see better support of all extracurricular activities."", 'Overall, Piscataway High School is a great place for opportunities.

They also help us receive the clubs and sports activities we decide to participate in before our many benefits.

This school is the best four years of your life. The school provides plenty of clubs and activities to keep yourself occupied. Long term friends will be met and relationships will form over the years.  I have loved PHS over the years, but the one flaw it can have is their lunches. Food in PHS hasn't been the greatest, to be honest. The teachers in our school work hard in order to ensure that our future is where it is supposed to be. Classes are diverse and plenty of races in our school. Our community continues to work hard and give back when the opportunity arises.

I'm proud to have called PHS my home for the last three years and hope that my senior year will be filled with much success."", 'Send your child somewhere else. I absolutely hated it and i know many students ( including me ) who DREADED coming here. Yes , the education here is good and better than some but there’s a lot of favoritism and unfair treatment in the school. Authority does nothing to make students feel whole or to make them feel equal. They pick on who they want and its not healthy.I know students who literally say they feel like its PRISON. We were always under heavy restriction and this school loves to try to sweep things under the rug and hide what really happens here. My parents even helped me write this review. They see how draining it was for me and my brother.  I’d send my child elsewhere for a learning environment where she or he feels comfortable and wanted.', 'I like the education that you are given here.

When I was a freshman I was new to the Piscataway school district and didn't know anyone. Luckily, most of the students and staff there are very accepting and are willing to talk to people they don't know. The school is very diverse having many different cultures making the atmosphere very welcoming and accepting. One downside to the high school is how big it is. When I first came to the school I easily got lost and I was even 10 minutes late to class because I could not figure out where the classroom was. Other than that the high school is great. They offer a variety of different clubs and sports as well as after school tutoring if a student needs extra help."", 'What I like about Piscataway high school is its very mixed and a lot of diversity and a great high school to practice your craft and academics. what id like to see change in the high school is the way people treat each other because some people treat other people with so much disrespect.', 'Piscataway High School is very diverse. This gives the opportunity to students to interact with one another more. They make sure that all students and staff are safe with their safety precautions they put in place. Because of safety, they sometimes have to close the library which gives the students limited resources to use.', ""I can honestly say Piscataway High is not a bad school in slightest. There are many teachers there that care about the students and are very down to earth. It's not all good though. Not enough money is put into the arts or sports that aren't football.

Most of the teachers have constant attitudes towards their students, even the best and sweetest students. Most teachers do not teach well what so ever. Most teachers struggle when you have a question too. I have no been taught to properly write an essay as well. Kids who take AP courses tend to say most good things about their teachers but, if you do not have any AP courses then no one has a single good thing to say at all. There are constant fist fights at this school, and very poor behavior. The security guards really do not do a good job at guarding this school considering so much gets past them. The faculty perceive themselves as non caring as well, or even helping with issues. Also the only thing the principal cares about is football. However, there are some sweet caring students that attend these schools. Also there are a few teachers that really do care.', 'Piscataway has a many electives and core classes to choose from to fit many interests. It can seem a little complicated to complete all your requirements if you wish to take one elective all four years, but it can be done.', ""Piscataway High School is welcoming to all students and provides a chance for each person to succeed. The resources for success are provided and faculty are always ready to help when needed. The only change I'd like to see is for more college readiness to be provided at earlier grades.

They also take a lot of time to help you do well.', 'The teachers are very friendly and their classes are very interesting. One thing that has to change is the huge emphasis on lateness.

The school is also very large which makes it exciting because everyday in the hallways you are bound to meet new people. All of the students and teachers are honestly great as well. The teachers here are very caring and want to see you  succeed. Although the classes may be tough if you take AP or honors, teachers will always make sure you get the extra help you need. I have met amazing friends at this High school that I hope I can keep in my life forever.', 'I really appreciated the diversity of students and the excellence of teaching at Piscataway High School The enthusiasm in the school has increased over the last four years that I have attended. Much of that is due to Principal Jason Lester who arrived 5 years ago. Chris Sumner, ""Doc"" has instilled passion in his marching band in spite of any trial that comes our way. I feel challenged and prepared for college as I take 4 AP classes and 5 AP exams this year to enter college with several credits under my belt. Piscataway High School has ranked high in both academics, sports and music. I feel prepared for college in every way as I have gleaned from the many diverse experiences that I have learned from at PHS.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Throughout my 4 years I took engineering classes where I was exposed to different types/fields of engineering.

Now as I go into college, I'll have a lot of background knowledge about topics that my classes will consist of."", 'I really liked the fact that we get to study the majors of engineering, construction and architecture while in high school.

The best things about the school is length of the school day where your classes are effective but you arent learning too much to overwhelm yourself. The school is very involved with a sports and keep up that fun vibe that keeps students attentive to learning and being themselves."", 'This school is where you will have the most fun, the teachers, staff and the environment is very enjoyable.

Since the school has a small population of students, teachers can get to know their students, their strength, and their weaknesses. As a result, students can address their teachers about their weaknesses along with get extra help if they need. The school's three different majors, Construction, Architecture, and Engineering generally gives students a taste of what woking in the actual field might feel like.

Overall, this school does a great job in introducing and exposing students to the three fields it specializes in."", 'There are 3 majors in this school, construction trades, engineering, and architecture. I am a sophomore majoring in architecture. I like that in this school there are many hands on activities that you can do that relates to your major. For example, in sophomore architecture you do model making and architectural drafting. The school overall is pretty diverse and have many students from different backgrounds. One thing that I think the school should offer is to have trips to see how and what people in these fields are doing.', ""At first it seemed like a nice school especially freshman year, because there were more teachers especially good teachers that knew how to teach. Later on as all the good teachers started leaving the school turned out to be terrible. The deans and teachers only care about the uniform policy more than our college readiness. The guidance counselor isn't the nicest so nobody ever feels comfortable to ask her questions at times because they are afraid of her response. However, there are good sports teams, good couches and very few but good teachers that you can rely on. Overall I believe the school needs to work on how the students are doing academically rather than what their wearing physically."", 'High School for construction gets you well prepared to become college ready and it is a very safe environment. There are a lot of resources for kids to learn and very good teachers if you need any help.  With a little bit of hard work so many opportunities will come to you. There is a lot of extra curricular activities and clubs to keep you involved. Teachers and students work together like a family and are very supportive of one another.

Their security is laughable considering students sneak in and out during the school day all the time, and their refusal to up their security is because they want to keep a ""kumbaya"" type of image with the community. They hire teachers that aren\'t passionate about what they do, and overlook the ones that are by making them teach subjects they don\'t specialize in or underpay them. The students have been clearly spoiled by parents, teachers, and administration all their lives. Many students in the AP program clearly don\'t deserve to be there.

They are helpful in everyway and will be a great guiding hand through a student's four years of high school. The usage of phones should change in this High School. Since students are allowed to use their phones in and out of classrooms, it does tend to detrack them from their studies.

Every teacher is amazing and never makes a kid feel horrible or stupid. They always help you if you have a question and will always work with you if they see you trying. Comsewogue is one if not the best school district."", 'Attending Comsewogue High School for the last four years has been great. I believe that it is a great school and it offers a great learning experience. Administration is very kind and very helpful along with all the staff. There are many club and sport opportunities to pursue and succeed in. I believe that I am strongly prepared for college after attending this high school especially in the English department.
