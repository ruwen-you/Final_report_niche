Stuyvesant High School,"['I loved my time there, it helped me prepare for college in a way that other students who come to college are not. The academics are off the charts. One thing I would like to see is a bit more diversity.', ""I think Stuy really challenges (in the best way) its students in terms of classes and workload, which is a really important thing because it helps develop the way you think but also exposes you to so many new things. After Stuy, college (even a top university) is significantly easier. The faculty here is amazing and very involved with their students; we get the opportunity to hear from politicians to head surgeons to CEOs. We also have access to so many different resources within the school and outside in NYC. Even though it can be tough sometimes, I would choose Stuy ten-times over if I could go back in time. The people that I've met here are seriously brilliant and caring, and the conversations held in the hallways and classrooms alone can teach you so much. My only regret is that I'm a senior and will be leaving soon."", 'Stuyvesant can be very stressful but I think it prepared me well for college.

The teachers offer help if you don't understand anything and there are great tutoring programs too if you don't feel comfortable with a teacher. My Global teacher even offers help with creating a schedule to make sure you aren't overloaded. There's one teacher I particularly don't like, but hey that's just me. There's a lot of clubs here and the school tries to pull you and your parents into practically everything. Oh, check your transportation every day.

Despite a lack of student diversity, the faculty excels in preparing students for college. Admission to the school is screened. For me, I found the vast amount of extracurricular activities to choose from really help me understand what I was interested in when I was unsure. At Stuyvesant, competition to be at the top of your class and maintain good grades is especially tough, and so extracurriculars give most people, including me, a life outside of that. One thing I would like to see changed is the attitude of some faculty members after they have been tenured.

There was always a sense of competition, yet friendliness in the halls. However, this competition-like atmosphere negatively impacted me.

For example, if you were voted as the president for Freshmen Caucus, it is very likely for you to be voted in again for the president for Sophomore Caucus and likewise for the Student Union.

However, teachers overwhelm their students unhealthily with the amount of work they give to the point where one does think oof education as learning but more of memorization and sleepless nights.

I\'ve had teachers who were intentionally as bad as they could be so that they wouldn\'t have to teach the next year (teachers at BCA aren\'t fired, they\'re transferred to other positions). There is blatant racism against students who aren’t white or asian, which the school ignores. Finally, many of the reports by the administration are misleading: the drop out percentage for my grade is about 6% with more than 15 students having dropped out (this isn\'t counted as dropping out by the admin tho, since they still graduate from other high schools).', 'Bergen County Academies is a great high school to attend if you are looking for a challenge.

In this way, BCA prepares students for the amount of coursework and the level of difficulty that they will ultimately face during their college career. However, while some teachers are extremely knowledgable in their respective fields, many do not teach well and do not encourage students to pursue their interests due to the amount of difficulty and confusion that they encounter during the course. Additionally, there is a heavy focus on STEM rather than the humanities. The STEM courses offered have more resources and are given more attention than the humanities courses. The student counseling offered at BCA has also been known to be unhelpful, and discourages students to reach out during their struggles.', ""In terms of academics and college readiness, there is no doubt that BCA excels in this area. However, the culture at this school definitely can change. Stress and no sleep is basically a norm, it is almost odd to be getting more than 5 hours a day. It can cultivate an unhealthy mindset of what is failing or doing well. There have been instances of teachers embarrassing students in class for whatever grades they receive. Of course it's important to clarify that this does not make up the entirety of BCA. There are teachers, counselors, and faculty members that clearly care and have been nothing short of amazing. However, it's also important to note this school may not be the best place for mental wellness. In addition, there is a clear disconnect between the administrators and students. As far as activities, there is a lot of people to meet and a lot to be involved in, so take advantage of it. BCA has been mixed with the good and the bad.

It all depends on your mindset coming here. If you think you are going to hate it, you probably will. If you keep an open mind and remember the long-term opportunities stemming from this school, you will realize how truly lucky you are to go here.', 'I think that this is a great environment for kids to become both great students and people.  What is learned here reaches further than what textbooks can do.', 'BCA provides one of the most academically challenging educations in New Jersey. It is widely rated as one of the best schools in the United States. It has great facilities, lots of opportunities to succeed, and prepares one for college, but this comes with its own problems. Due to the academic focus of all the students, there is a culture of pure academic focus with minimal focus on social interactions. The culture in bca is purely academically focused, but it does not matter what your interests are, if you are admitted to bca, nearly all students are very friendly.', ""Honestly, I am happy I came to BCA. I am a Med freshman, who would not have nearly as many opportunities to succeed if I went to my town high school. However, BCA is extremely hard and you have to really want your goals for this school to be worth it. My advice: Don't come here unless you are ready to compete in everything you do, and are willing to give up your sleep to succeed."", 'Bergen County Academies is an extremely competitive school. Not only is the curriculum vigorous, but the students are also very studious and diligent. As a current student, I believe that the administration should be more lenient. There are so many unnecessary detentions that, frankly, is very upsetting. However, the academics is extremely challenging, even if the workload should be lightened up more to allow students to feel more relaxed, especially since everyone is extremely stressed with in school and out of school activities.', 'BCA offered an incredible community of intelligent, collaborative, and highly-motivated students and incredible faculty that really challenged me to keep improving myself in academics, extracurriculars, and social situations. The work load certainly was stressful at times, but the depth of the classes and assignments prepared me very well for my first year of college, especially when it came to science courses and time management.', ""I love BCA. Opportunities and possibilities are endless, and everyone's always pushing you to be better."", 'I liked the rigor of the courses at Bergen County Academies and the opportunities for research and competitions would not be available to me otherwise. However, I have consistently felt that the administration did not value the voice of the students. Many of the problems at this school arise from the fact that the administration does not communicate effectively with students. Many teachers are very knowledgeable in their respective subject area but do not have experience in teaching it just in knowing it. This causes a lot of information to be thrown at the students without being properly explained to the students. Finally, the long school day could be shortened and start later in the day to allow students to sleep in which would assist the large amount of coursework and overworking culture at BCA.', 'Unbeatable academics and preparation for college. Knowledgeable, helpful teachers. Talented and friendly students. My experience at the Bergen County Academies has been amazing.If you are applying, I suggest the science, engineering, computer science, and business academies (if you are interested in these subjects/related careers).', 'Bergen County Academies is a school that will definitely prepare you for life. This idea of an institution where students are focused on their education builds an atmosphere that is upbuilding and inspirational for all. After the competitive application, the number of resources and opportunities are endless for anyone. The clubs, projects, and electives distinguish BCA by offering courses that fit with all interests. In addition, the free time in between classes makes this school seem more manageable and convenient. Also, the sports here are incredible but require a lot of commitment. In reality, however, BCA is overwhelming as the rigorous classes, successful and intelligent teachers, and high standards placed upon the students make life seem impossible to conquer. However, I think BCA puts this stress on us, the students, in order for us to prepare for real life. This means that the complexity of this school makes our future seem brighter, more accessible, and approachable.', 'Yes, this school is prestigious and rigorous. However, this leaves you little time for other activities. Your whole life revolves around academics. While some teachers are helpful and knowledgeable, others are bullies and make you feel stupid for not understanding something. A lot of the teachers don’t teach but still expect you to know the material. Competition is toxic at this school. Students always try to outdo each other, and it leaves you feeling stressed all the time. Cheating is common, but nothing is done about it. All the students want to go to an Ivy League school, and end up feeling like a failure if they don’t get in.', 'Bergen County Academies is what would be expected of a public magnet high school. The opportunities in academics, research, and clubs are immense and students can really do what they want to do. The schedule is unique in that there is free time throughout the day to do homework, socializing, or taking more classes. The work culture is not for everyone as it can be intensive at times and students complain/brag about how little sleep they get. The school day is the longest in New Jersey (8:00AM-4:10PM) and the bus can add up to 3 hours to that (6:35AM-5:30PM). Teachers are required to be intelligent, but some are not the best at actually teaching. Overall, nerd culture reigns supreme and going here a student will learn a lot both in knowledge and other skills like time management, but they may have to give external activities in the process.', 'One of the issues with BCA is how little you sleep. The workload is a shock as a freshman, and is very intense and rigorous throughout the four years. There is a lot of toxic competition in the school, which leads to a lot of negative emotion and feelings of failure.', 'Bergen County Academies has prepared me for my future. I have had a wonderful experience with other students as well as teachers. My knowledge has expanded beyond what I expected.', 'The teachers here don’t teach and they expect you to know so much. They’ll assign a reading and yell at you if you don’t know what something is and expect you to know it without even teaching you. The teachers don’t care about mental health at all and every student wonders why they are still they and why they don’t just transfer out. Kids are always distressed and teachers never care. It seems like they’re setting you up for failure and if you’re not as smart as everyone else then teachers will look down on you and make fun of you. It is a miserable place to be.', 'Since I applied here last year, in a good way, I am a different person. I am more self- confident because of all the amazing people and opportunities there are. Although the work is challenging, it will prepare me better for college.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Like with any high school, there are a few problem areas, but IMO, the pros outweigh the cons.  My school is very liberal and open-minded.  It is able to bring together students from all over the county, which results in a lot of different views during class discussions.  There are certain teachers that don't really try to teach well, but for the most part, the teachers are unique and great.  Classes are small and more project-based, and most alumni from this school say that the school has prepared them for college more than people they know from other schools.  What I really like about this school is that everyone who is here wants to be here.  In order to get into this school, students were required to show good grades in middle school and take an entrance exam.  So everyone is here by choice.  In my hometown's high school, many students do not want to be at the school.  As a result, they are rude, difficult, and do not try in class.  But here, the students are supposed to be the smartest in the county.  They try very hard in their classes, and sometimes unfortunately are very competitive, but you never feel like your learning experience is disrupted by people who don't want to be there.  In addition, the campus is ridiculously safe.  There's a police academy on the campus, and in my whole time being here, I've never seen a fight, and bullying is kept to a minimum.  All in all, I love this school, and although it can be ridiculously hard at times, I'm glad I'm here."", ""Health programs are good, we only have one school nurse in the entire campus which isn't the best, safety is pretty good considering we're right next to a police academy, bullying does not happen often at all."", ""There are quite a few clubs available, most of which have a STEM or business focus.  The clubs are good and are run well, but membership is iffy depending on the club.  Also, since the school is quite far for most students, after school clubs don't always have the most attendees."", ""The whole campus is incredibly supportive to their students. Whatever difficulty you have they will accommodate like not being able to pay for your prom ticket, missing school for an international sports competition, or lack of technology available at home. While students might not like each other, there is no issue of bullying on campus because each class size is so small that we all knew it wasn't worth it to start drama and make the atmosphere awkward for yourself. The only downside would be the lack of interaction between all the schools, but honestly that's really a self effort that you should make yourself if you're eager to socialise."", ""You will meet some of the best teachers of your life here. Others will lead classes in which the students are basically teaching themselves. However the type of education you receive from all styles of teachers actually proves to be very beneficial. Some teachers will actually teach you way more valuable life skills than they will their own respective academic subject areas. Even the rudest and grouchiest teachers will always be considerate of anything you have going in your life if your academic performance starts to be affected. You can email any staff member and most of the time they will respond within 2 days. Grading isn't always fair, to be honest you will have teachers that have deliberate favourites and have very biased ways of grading, but its a good way of easing in the harsh reality that most everywhere in life people are biased.

Many classes are taught by students who have already taught in the field. Although the courses are challenging, there is an excellent support system among classmates. Since admissions is test-based, the students are all highly-motivated and will push you to be your best. We are ranked #4 in Newsweek (2016) and the high school definitely prepares you for life beyond high school. The renovation of the multimedia center into a Makerspace, with 3-D printers, a laser cutter, a CNC mill, and a CNC lathe, is extremely exciting and will breathe new life into the school.', ""The academics are pretty good.  We have core curriculum requirements but they aren't the worst, especially if you're interested in engineering.  We could have a few more options for classes, because most classes tend to be focused on math, science, or technology."", ""This school is ridiculously accepting.  There are, of course, a few racist, mean people here and there, but for the most part, everyone is very accepting.  We have multicultural and GSA clubs, for the most part we are very open-minded, and bullying happens very very rarely.  We are diverse not only in ethnicity, but also in where we are from within the county.  The only problem I have is with the competitiveness; everyone wants to get straight A's and get into Ivy League schools, and it can be a little disheartening when you get a 60% on a test and you hear someone complaining about their 97%."", ""The teachers are pretty good, some don't try very hard to teach, and they just lecture you every single day.  On the other hand, some come up with really engaging projects and discussions.  It's a hit or miss."", ""My overall experience in this school has been really great, to be honest.  Like with any high school, there are a few problem areas, but IMO, the pros outweigh the cons.  My school is very liberal and open-minded.  It is able to bring together students from all over the county, which results in a lot of different views during class discussions.  There are certain teachers that don't really try to teach well, but for the most part, the teachers are unique and great.  Classes are small and more project-based, and most alumni from this school say that the school has prepared them for college more than people they know from other schools.  What I really like about this school is that everyone who is here wants to be here.  In order to get into this school, students were required to show good grades in middle school and take an entrance exam.  So everyone is here by choice.  In my hometown's high school, many students do not want to be at the school.  As a result, they are rude, difficult, and do not try in class.  But here, the students are supposed to be the smartest in the county.  They try very hard in their classes, and sometimes unfortunately are very competitive, but you never feel like your learning experience is disrupted by people who don't want to be there.  In addition, the campus is ridiculously safe.  There's a police academy on the campus, and in my whole time being here, I've never seen a fight, and bullying is kept to a minimum.  All in all, I love this school, and although it can be ridiculously hard at times, I'm glad I'm here."", ""Health programs are good, we only have one school nurse in the entire campus which isn't the best, safety is pretty good considering we're right next to a police academy, bullying does not happen often at all."", ""There are quite a few clubs available, most of which have a STEM or business focus.  The clubs are good and are run well, but membership is iffy depending on the club.  Also, since the school is quite far for most students, after school clubs don't always have the most attendees."", ""The whole campus is incredibly supportive to their students. Whatever difficulty you have they will accommodate like not being able to pay for your prom ticket, missing school for an international sports competition, or lack of technology available at home. While students might not like each other, there is no issue of bullying on campus because each class size is so small that we all knew it wasn't worth it to start drama and make the atmosphere awkward for yourself. The only downside would be the lack of interaction between all the schools, but honestly that's really a self effort that you should make yourself if you're eager to socialise."", ""You will meet some of the best teachers of your life here. Others will lead classes in which the students are basically teaching themselves. However the type of education you receive from all styles of teachers actually proves to be very beneficial. Some teachers will actually teach you way more valuable life skills than they will their own respective academic subject areas. Even the rudest and grouchiest teachers will always be considerate of anything you have going in your life if your academic performance starts to be affected. You can email any staff member and most of the time they will respond within 2 days. Grading isn't always fair, to be honest you will have teachers that have deliberate favourites and have very biased ways of grading, but its a good way of easing in the harsh reality that most everywhere in life people are biased. Overall as a community, everyone supports each other. If you dislike your own teacher, you can always approach past teachers of the same subject or go seek out someone that has never personally taught you, teachers are most always ready to help you."", 'many clubs and resources available', 'This is an amazing school, it prepares the students to go above and beyond. It provides them with all the resources they need. The teachers are very dedicated and prepared.', 'There are virtually no ""cliques"" or selective groups in the school.  With a grade of only 70-80 people, you have learn to learn to like everybody at least a little!  There\'s no peer pressure to do drugs or anything at all; the only peer pressure experienced is peer pressure to ""advance a math level"" over the summer.  \r There are a few LGBT people and the school is accepting, though there are a few people from conservative backgrounds.

Townsend Harris High School,"[""The three months that I have attended this school for have caused me to have a positive impression on it. Freshman year of high school comprises a myriad of difficulties and with the assistance I am currently receiving from all the staff, I haven't experienced any of the hardships I expected yet. The school's welcoming nature allows students to adjust rapidly and call it their second home in no time. One of my favorite things about this school is how much they care for the students, for there is a testing schedule to prevent stress and to help us manage the rigorous course. Despite all the phenomenal aspects of this high school, much of the student body, including me, wish the physical education class wasn't this intense, as we are mandated to run unpleasant miles frequently. Aside from that, Townsend Harris High School is an overall outstanding school and I am looking forward to gaining an amazing high school experience throughout all the years to come!"", ""Townsend Harris provided me with a wholesome high school experience that I I don't believe I would've gotten elsewhere. The school's vast resources and the teachers who provided me with an education truly helped shape me and allowed me to carry what I learned into college."", ""Townsend Harris is a competitive school that gets students college ready. There are many cultural and diverse activities that students can look forward to during the school year. Everyone in this school is tightly knit together and no one is afraid to speak up. The seminar styled classes also help to enhance everyone's speaking skills and give them a better sense of what they are learning in class."", ""Townsend Harris High School, recently ranked #1 in New York, goes above and beyond. Though advertised as a humanities school, it is equally strong in both the humanities and the sciences. You're enrolled in AP World History in your freshman and sophomore year, allowing enough preparation for the AP with amazing history teachers. In freshman year, we are also required to take a course called Writing Process to prepare us for future classical language classes like Latin or Ancient Greek. Without it, I wouldn't have known the difference between a direct and indirect object. The science department is full of fun, intelligent teachers. I've had a teacher who sacrificed a gummy bear in the name of a chemistry demonstration and a teacher who performed a handstand to demonstrate the workings of 3' and 5' RNA strands to form DNA in AP Biology."", 'Its such an amazing school I am genuinely so happy with my decision to go here.

Most of the teachers taught really well (I think the Math and Language Departments stood out in particular) and the education I received here really prepared me for life at a top university. I do wish there were more AP classes offered but because the school is a small one, I understand why there are less APs offered than other schools. Physical education is taken very seriously at Townsend which is different from other schools and I think this is very good because it teaches students about healthy living. The I use the things I learned in weight lifting class in college now. Overall, a really good high school.', ""I love the close-knit atmosphere of Townsend Harris. The students aren't cutthroat or competitive, even though everyone is smart. Everyone is always willing to help each other out, share information and be there for you. Our school is small, so it feels like a big family. However, if you don't participate in extracurriculars, you may not feel this way. If I didn't join the activities that I did, I would not be as happy as I am here. Students are always stressed about something, and we never get enough sleep because of our activities and intense workload.If I were to improve anything, it would be the communication between the administration, students and parents.

There are many clubs and activities that allow students to build new friendships and new experiences. The environment of the school motivates each student to try their best. Through many experiences, there are many lessons I learned while attending Townsend Harris that other schools would not have provided me.', ""Townsend has allowed me to grow as a student and as a person by challenging me and pushing me outside of my comfort zone.

Townsend Harris always allows for a calm and interesting learning environment. You meet so many cool people and will form so many great relationships.', 'Townsend Harris is a highly competitive school with a welcoming community of students who genuinely support and care for another. The environment is very academic and safe, and violence is almost nonexistent. While the school does offer a plethora of different classes, a number of teachers often seem to fall short (although there are some who are amazing and beloved by students). Students at Townsend Harris are also overworked and overwhelmed, brought to unbearable levels of stress by pressure and requirements. There are a lot of issues with the way the school is run and some of its policies upset both staff and students, as well. However, the school does try to take students and their opinions into account by way of emailed surveys. And, despite its lack of organization and the way students are crippled by work and tests, this school is one of the best places to push young minds as far as they can go (for better or worse), to explore their interests, and become part of a community.', 'Overall Townsend Harris is a good high school.  I am more of a STEM person but Townsend is a humanity school so to me, I don’t really like the classes I am taking. We are required to take either Latin or Greek in addition to modern language. The humanity teachers are also really bad but all students are really smart so we just self study. The school should have more AP classes.', 'Townsend Harris has great elective and AP options, as well as many clubs and sports. The vast majority of students are involved in at least one of these clubs or sports. The students are very driven and smart as well. The school is safe and the environment is not alarming in a bad way. Basically, all the students go to a four-year college program right after graduation. The students can be a little too uptight about grades, as some think that perfectly fine grades (like an 85 on a regent) low although it is fine in other schools. In addition, some teachers are inadequate and the students have a hard time learning from them.', ""Amazing school with very motivated students. Although it's known as a humanities school, Townsend Harris has clubs and teams for math and science. Most teachers are knowledgeable and can teach."", 'I am going into my senior year of high school, and there was a lot to adapt into during the 3 years at Townsend, but Townsend does prepare you for college in many ways and there are many resources and trustful adults you can go to if you feel overwhelmed or stressed out in your studies and the workload, social life, time management  is gonna be a lot to take in but that whats will prepare you in real life.', 'It is a great school.

Not only did they help me develop academically but also socially and professionally. It was a safe, fun, inviting place to be and I met amazing people who I still talk to 4 years later.

Freshman year of high school comprises a myriad of difficulties and with the assistance I am currently receiving from all the staff, I haven't experienced any of the hardships I expected yet. The school's welcoming nature allows students to adjust rapidly and call it their second home in no time. One of my favorite things about this school is how much they care for the students, for there is a testing schedule to prevent stress and to help us manage the rigorous course. Despite all the phenomenal aspects of this high school, much of the student body, including me, wish the physical education class wasn't this intense, as we are mandated to run unpleasant miles frequently.

In freshman year, we are also required to take a course called Writing Process to prepare us for future classical language classes like Latin or Ancient Greek. Without it, I wouldn't have known the difference between a direct and indirect object. The science department is full of fun, intelligent teachers.

If I didn't join the activities that I did, I would not be as happy as I am here. Students are always stressed about something, and we never get enough sleep because of our activities and intense workload.If I were to improve anything, it would be the communication between the administration, students and parents.

This is also when the IB (International Baccalaureate) program is formally introduced. The IB program is the only bad part of attending this school. In my opinion it is not explained well enough when first applying to the school, and by the time you realize that the IB program not very valuable and incredibly stress inducing, it is too late. The classes themselves are taught well by great instructors, however I have found assignments like CAS to either be limited in value, not explained well enough by guidance staff, or tedious to the point where most value it has is killed off.

Although it is a STEM school, the administrators try to foster a school culture that allows students to express their abilities and talents. However, this fails in the eyes of other high schools that actually put time, attention, and effort in letting extracurriculars flourish. Additionally, Biotech states that the workload is manageable, however, it honestly isn't. While teachers are amazingly qualified and caring, many don't recognize the sheer amount of work they place on students. Students have volunteering, sports, extracurriculars, jobs, family and social lives to attend to, and many have to sacrifice to do school assignments. It's even worse for upperclassmen who have extra IB required assessments to attend to. After a while, the lackluster of Biotech fades and students realize that while they are in an academic-heavy environment, they are essentially in a sheltered community that isn't very reminiscent of reality."", 'Great education.

First, being that this is a STEM-oriented school, the courses electives offer little variety. While many students pursue artistic endeavors on their own time, coming here certainly doesn\'t help. You have basically no control over your schedule besides choosing between Chem and Physics as an upperclassman. There is also a strong status quo in terms of clubs.

It is said that students can create clubs and organization, but proposed clubs are neglected by the administration.  Most get closed down. Little to no art/music in the curriculum.

This is also when the IB (International Baccalaureate) program is formally introduced. The IB program is the only bad part of attending this school. In my opinion it is not explained well enough when first applying to the school, and by the time you realize that the IB program not very valuable and incredibly stress inducing, it is too late. The classes themselves are taught well by great instructors, however I have found assignments like CAS to either be limited in value, not explained well enough by guidance staff, or tedious to the point where most value it has is killed off. I was able to use 0 IB credits when registering for classes in university. I maintain that, even with IB, the incredible environment, challenging coursework, like minded classmates, and enthusiastic teachers made going to Biotech well worth it.', 'Biotech is a great school for students who know they want to go into science. It is also a great place for kids to grow and learn about themselves.', ""I have highs and lows when it comes to Biotechnology HS. Although it is a STEM school, the administrators try to foster a school culture that allows students to express their abilities and talents. However, this fails in the eyes of other high schools that actually put time, attention, and effort in letting extracurriculars flourish. Additionally, Biotech states that the workload is manageable, however, it honestly isn't. While teachers are amazingly qualified and caring, many don't recognize the sheer amount of work they place on students. Students have volunteering, sports, extracurriculars, jobs, family and social lives to attend to, and many have to sacrifice to do school assignments. It's even worse for upperclassmen who have extra IB required assessments to attend to. After a while, the lackluster of Biotech fades and students realize that while they are in an academic-heavy environment, they are essentially in a sheltered community that isn't very reminiscent of reality."", 'Great education. Completely prepares students for college. But there is WAY too much homework/busy work. Very hard for kids to have a balanced life.', ""I love Biotech because it's such a small school and it allowed me to become who I really am. I'm generally a shy person, and having experience with just 80 kids in my class allowed me to bloom. Most of the teachers are excellent, with a few exceptions.

First, being that this is a STEM-oriented school, the courses electives offer little variety. While many students pursue artistic endeavors on their own time, coming here certainly doesn\'t help. You have basically no control over your schedule besides choosing between Chem and Physics as an upperclassman. There is also a strong status quo in terms of clubs.

I had an amazing time because of the clubs that I decided to join. Clubs at Great Neck South High are like families; they are inclusive, quirky, fun and unique.One thing that I would like to see change is the AP policy that our school has. We shouldn’t be required to pay ninety something dollars for a test just because we are in the AP class.

Bergen County Technical High School - Teterboro,"['Although I have enjoyed my time at the Bergen County Technical High School, I have found difficulty in the simplest of tasks including starting a club, speaking to administration without feeling put down, and finding teachers that grade me fairly based on the class I am taking. In comparison to other schools including the Bergen County Academies, the administration is incredibly strict and rude to an extent that students despise and cower in fear from them. While some teachers and incredible, others are extremely harsh and do not teach at a high school level but instead at a college level. Specifically one of the business teachers has made the past couple of years for BT students a nightmare however, administration fails to remove her from her job despite the terror she has inflicted on the lives of business major students. On the other hand, Bergen Tech has challenged me and incentivized me to work diligently towards my goals.', 'Bergen Tech has made me very prepared for college, and has taught me how to manage a heavy and academically-challenging work load. Along with this, the teachers are great and teach you skills that you can apply to other classes opposed to just memorizing information.', 'My experience here has been a positivie one.  I feel prepared to go foward and follow my journey through college.  The faculty in this school is great I just hope to see a larger variety in class electives prior to senior year.', 'By being in an environment in which likeminded students were put together, my time at Bergen Tech was made better with the easy access to friends. The people at this school were often very kind and approachable, making the overall experience much more enjoyable. The teachers were available for help whenever necessary, and were also very kind. I had poor experiences with very few teachers, which in a way weakened my liking of the school as a whole. However, the school was a very welcoming place and I had a very pleasant high school experience.', ""Could not fit my (abbreviated) review of BT in the 1000 character limit imposed by this website, so I have pasted it into a pastebin link which you can access here: https://pastebin.com/Nv6cmrnhSummary: BT sucks, don't go here if you don't want to cut your lifespan by a decade."", ""Bergen Tech was really great in preparing me for college. There were many things I learned in my AP Biology class that I'm now learning more in depth about in my third year of college. The curriculum at Bergen Tech is a lot more accelerated than those of other public schools. I do remember there being quite a bit of drama surrounding sexual harassment and the administrative staff so that didn't make my experience the most enjoyable but other than that, I am grateful to have been able to get my high school education from Bergen Tech."", 'As a current Senior, Bergen Tech has been a great experience. While it was difficult to adjust to when I  was a freshman, I definitely grew as a person there. Everyone is friendly and it is a great environment. Workload is difficult, but it is worth it by the end of the day. Overall BT is great.', 'Teterboro offers a wide variety of Advanced Placement options, but the majors limit your flexibility in choosing classes. In addition, our field is very small and the lack of windows makes the place sometimes feel very encapsulating.', 'Overall, BT is a very academically challenging school. Students and the staff alike are very intelligent. Two major downsides to this school however. 1) It’s location is across the street from an airport, which means the air quality index is terrible and the noise from aircrafts landing and taking off can sometimes be overbearing. 2) You cannot change your major once you apply to BT. In my opinion, there should be a one week period where freshmen are allowed to try out each major, and then decide what program they are most interested in. Athletics program is well below average, with the exception of a few sports.', 'Bergen Tech is a very academically rigorous high school with very smart students and staff. The teachers are extremely helpful and there is a wide variety of clubs and extracurriculars to select from. The only downside about Bergen Tech is its location.', 'It is a great school. The academic curriculum is rigorous and allows students to push themselves further. However, the sports department is not the strongest, and the arts department is not truly valued. The school is focused on academics and helps prepare students for college and university.', 'It’s a pretty good school, more academic rigor than most, but the selection you have over classes is subpar because of the Major you choose for the next four years. There’s no changing it like you would in college, which I hate because I regret mine. Horrible athletics other than a few sports', 'Excellent school extremely challenging. Teachers are always available to assist. The classes that are offered are all honors and above preparing students for next level education.', 'This is a very good place to learn more about a specific field that you may go on to study for in college. The teachers are helpful and very knowledgeable in their subjects, and even though it is stressful at times, it is a fulfilling experience.', 'Bergen Tech is an incredible school for those who wish to challenge themselves. The teachers and administration pride themselves in making sure students are ready for college within their four years as Knights.', 'Bergen County Technical High School in Teterboro has a great environment, filled with an encouraging and helpful community.', 'They really prepare you with the workload for college and the teachers are very helpful and supporting.  However, the work can become very overbearing at times and become too much for the students to handle, escpecially those who have after school commitments like sports and/or activities.', 'I have been going to Bergen Tech for the last four years. I will definitely say that for anyone looking to challenge themselves academically, this school is definitely worth applying to. There are AP classes for just about every subject being offered as early as freshman year. For the most part, the teachers are great and know the material well, as well as offer extra help if necessary nearly every day. The school is unique in that it has ""majors"", such as computer science, business, engineering, law, fashion, and others. These classes provide a basic look at what a major has to offer to help a student decide if this is something they might be interested in. There is a large amount of extracurricular activities and sports available as well. Overall, the school is definitely worth attending if you are willing to work harder than the average HS student to stay on top of your academics.', ""I like my major that I'm in at Bergen Tech. I also think the music program is amazing and filled with talented musicians. There could maybe be more windows and less ants in the school."", 'Overall, the Bergen County Technical High School - Teterboro is not a bad school. The student body is diverse, there are many academic opportunities to pursue, and the classes prepare you well for AP tests. But the school lacks any sort of student life. Outside of its classes, there is almost nothing going for the school. The clubs are a joke, the music program is sad, and don\'t even get me started about the school\'s ""field.""

In comparison to other schools including the Bergen County Academies, the administration is incredibly strict and rude to an extent that students despise and cower in fear from them. While some teachers and incredible, others are extremely harsh and do not teach at a high school level but instead at a college level. Specifically one of the business teachers has made the past couple of years for BT students a nightmare however, administration fails to remove her from her job despite the terror she has inflicted on the lives of business major students. On the other hand, Bergen Tech has challenged me and incentivized me to work diligently towards my goals.', 'Bergen Tech has made me very prepared for college, and has taught me how to manage a heavy and academically-challenging work load. Along with this, the teachers are great and teach you skills that you can apply to other classes opposed to just memorizing information.', 'My experience here has been a positivie one.  I feel prepared to go foward and follow my journey through college.  The faculty in this school is great I just hope to see a larger variety in class electives prior to senior year.', 'By being in an environment in which likeminded students were put together, my time at Bergen Tech was made better with the easy access to friends. The people at this school were often very kind and approachable, making the overall experience much more enjoyable. The teachers were available for help whenever necessary, and were also very kind. I had poor experiences with very few teachers, which in a way weakened my liking of the school as a whole. However, the school was a very welcoming place and I had a very pleasant high school experience.', ""Could not fit my (abbreviated) review of BT in the 1000 character limit imposed by this website, so I have pasted it into a pastebin link which you can access here: https://pastebin.com/Nv6cmrnhSummary: BT sucks, don't go here if you don't want to cut your lifespan by a decade."", ""Bergen Tech was really great in preparing me for college. There were many things I learned in my AP Biology class that I'm now learning more in depth about in my third year of college. The curriculum at Bergen Tech is a lot more accelerated than those of other public schools. I do remember there being quite a bit of drama surrounding sexual harassment and the administrative staff so that didn't make my experience the most enjoyable but other than that, I am grateful to have been able to get my high school education from Bergen Tech."", 'As a current Senior, Bergen Tech has been a great experience. While it was difficult to adjust to when I  was a freshman, I definitely grew as a person there. Everyone is friendly and it is a great environment. Workload is difficult, but it is worth it by the end of the day. Overall BT is great.', 'Teterboro offers a wide variety of Advanced Placement options, but the majors limit your flexibility in choosing classes. In addition, our field is very small and the lack of windows makes the place sometimes feel very encapsulating.', 'Overall, BT is a very academically challenging school. Students and the staff alike are very intelligent. Two major downsides to this school however. 1) It’s location is across the street from an airport, which means the air quality index is terrible and the noise from aircrafts landing and taking off can sometimes be overbearing. 2) You cannot change your major once you apply to BT. In my opinion, there should be a one week period where freshmen are allowed to try out each major, and then decide what program they are most interested in. Athletics program is well below average, with the exception of a few sports.', 'Bergen Tech is a very academically rigorous high school with very smart students and staff. The teachers are extremely helpful and there is a wide variety of clubs and extracurriculars to select from. The only downside about Bergen Tech is its location.', 'It is a great school. The academic curriculum is rigorous and allows students to push themselves further. However, the sports department is not the strongest, and the arts department is not truly valued. The school is focused on academics and helps prepare students for college and university.', 'It’s a pretty good school, more academic rigor than most, but the selection you have over classes is subpar because of the Major you choose for the next four years. There’s no changing it like you would in college, which I hate because I regret mine. Horrible athletics other than a few sports', 'Excellent school extremely challenging. Teachers are always available to assist. The classes that are offered are all honors and above preparing students for next level education.', 'This is a very good place to learn more about a specific field that you may go on to study for in college. The teachers are helpful and very knowledgeable in their subjects, and even though it is stressful at times, it is a fulfilling experience.', 'Bergen Tech is an incredible school for those who wish to challenge themselves. The teachers and administration pride themselves in making sure students are ready for college within their four years as Knights.', 'Bergen County Technical High School in Teterboro has a great environment, filled with an encouraging and helpful community.', 'They really prepare you with the workload for college and the teachers are very helpful and supporting.  However, the work can become very overbearing at times and become too much for the students to handle, escpecially those who have after school commitments like sports and/or activities.', 'I have been going to Bergen Tech for the last four years. I will definitely say that for anyone looking to challenge themselves academically, this school is definitely worth applying to. There are AP classes for just about every subject being offered as early as freshman year. For the most part, the teachers are great and know the material well, as well as offer extra help if necessary nearly every day. The school is unique in that it has ""majors"", such as computer science, business, engineering, law, fashion, and others. These classes provide a basic look at what a major has to offer to help a student decide if this is something they might be interested in. There is a large amount of extracurricular activities and sports available as well. Overall, the school is definitely worth attending if you are willing to work harder than the average HS student to stay on top of your academics.', ""I like my major that I'm in at Bergen Tech. I also think the music program is amazing and filled with talented musicians. There could maybe be more windows and less ants in the school."", 'Overall, the Bergen County Technical High School - Teterboro is not a bad school. The student body is diverse, there are many academic opportunities to pursue, and the classes prepare you well for AP tests. But the school lacks any sort of student life. Outside of its classes, there is almost nothing going for the school. The clubs are a joke, the music program is sad, and don\'t even get me started about the school\'s ""field.""

It is a program that demands all their time and energy and is extremely competitive.

The Academy students are prepared well for selective colleges and will be challenged daily. In the future, I would like to see more diversity in choosing accepted students and a culture of acceptance among fellow Academy students.', 'I love the setting where everyone is encouraged to pursue whatever they are passionate about. There are tons of maker spaces where students can get their creative juices flowing. I would have more lounge-type spaces in the school where students can collaborate and share ideas during lunch. The cafeteria can get quite boring sometimes.', ""The whole curriculum is well thought-out and does a great job setting up students for success in STEM-oriented fields. The students are all very intelligent and motivated to do well. While this can lead to competition between students, the small class size (although it has expanded since I graduated) and the joint camaraderie of going through this unique experience offsets this somewhat. Where the Academy continues to have issues is in teaching quality and diversity. While there are many teachers who care about the students and their teaching, there are many others who are more than happy to coast on the students' hard-working tendencies and do little in the way of real teaching.

With top notch academics, rigorous courses and top of the line teachers and administration, it is no wonder why alumni return and express upon current students how prepared they were for the work load and rigor that college students face. In addition to academics, Allied Health and the rest of the schools on its campus are home to many active clubs and activities, specifically including the Student Movement Against Cancer and Multicultural Club, which displays our school's diversity and drive toward helping others, and also encourages a multitude of parent involvement. Back in the classroom, students have access to many resources and are never a step behind in innovations in technology. Besides our average cafeteria food, Allied Health is an extraordinary, safe, diverse and academically challenging place to go to school."", 'Best high school ever.

The curriculum is very rigorous and is backed up with some of the best teachers I'll ever have. The only thing I didn't like was the lack of spirit, mainly due to the fact that we have no sports teams, no homecoming, no pep rallies, etc."", ""Throughout my years at AIT, there are many things that I found unique to this high school experience. I loved having the opportunity to meet people from different towns and cultures who had similar academic interests as me. There were also many career specific classes that were offered here that I wouldn't have been able to take at my town high school. The schedule is also really convenient. Since there is an A/B day schedule,  you have the opportunity to visit a teacher twice before the next lecture. This is helpful because the classes are very rigorous. The school itself is also student friendly: it’s clean, easy to get around, and it provides lots of places where students could do work or study. One thing that I did not like at first was that AIT did not have varsity sports, but as time progressed I started to find it pretty cool that your friends from school could be your rivals on the field (you have the opportunity to compete for your town’s team)."", 'This school was a great wat to get prepared for a career in any computer science or business related field. They have great teachers and facilities that really help students learn and grow.', ""I am very glad that I went to AIT because it prepared me for college in ways that I didn't think were possible. The curriculum is top-notch and the culture/environment is amazing and it can sometimes feel like a college campus. There are some drawbacks, like no sports teams, but you get accustomed to it after the first year or so. The faculty is a mix-bag because while there are some teachers and faculty members I still enjoy talking to; there is a fair amount that I would be glad if I never see again. But you can easily ask upperclassman and they will tell you who to avoid."", ""I love the opportunities provided by the school.

In general, I feel prepared for the future of college.', 'It is a great school with great kind and memorable people. It definitely challenges you and prepares you for college courses.', 'The Academy for Information Technology is a highly ranked vocational high school that focuses on Information Technology and Business. From the very beginning, my course work was very vocational focused. In addition, there are many opportunities for earning certifications which are incredibly useful for me not only for my college applications but future work opportunities. Due to the focused classes “fun” electives are usually not offered. AIT does not have sports which is a wasted opportunity due to the many athletes that go here. This also leads to a lack of school spirit. What the school lacks in sports it makes up for club; the most notable being our successful chapter of the Future Business Leaders of America. AIT is not for everyone, the rigorous and focused coursework requires a lot of work and dedication and makes many feel like they are missing out on the “normal” high school experience however, AIT can promise a unique experience that leaves you ready for the future.', 'Great school with great teaching facilities for anyone interested in Computer Science, Information Technology, and Business.', 'This school is part of a five school campus. AIT focuses on Business and Information Tech exclusively. The environment is super friendly and most teachers are understanding. All classes are honors level or higher which make it more challenging than your average school. Even though everyone is from a different town, the school system makes it possible for you to have time to work on group projects during school hours, participate in clubs, and participate in sports in your home town. The school does an amazing job in academics, I just wish we had more options for electives outside of AIT.', ""I'm having a wonderful experience at the Academy for Information Technology. The school acquires the best and the brightest students from around Union County. There's even an performance test just to enter even though it's a public school. The school provides a diversified environment for the ideal student and has excellent academic standards. All classes there are considered to be honors courses and has a ton of AP courses for college readiness. With a specialty in information technology and business, the students get a real sense of the real world experience.

The majority of teachers who I have had truly aim to educate their students, and create connections with their students to ensure that they understand the material that is being taught.

Got bullied here for several years by said student and nothing was ever done.', 'I believe that Manhasset High School is a great learning environment that provides students with the necessary support and resources needed to succeed. However, I have also seen that it is very easy to fall through the cracks and not get the most out of your time at Manhasset. Teachers will sometimes just give up and let you pass through without learning the necessary content that is required in other classes. There is a huge gap between students who really care about school and take all of the AP level classes and get really good grades and the students that simply pass through without getting the most out of their experience. When I got to college, I felt unprepared for the amount of work I was given that I had not experienced in high school. For example, I was never given proper instruction on how to write an academic essay.', 'manhasset high school is a great place for any student. There are so many opportunities for almost any interest at the school. We are extremely talented in sports and music with a variety of sports clubs and music groups. We even have theatre. The school is very good with being a learning friendly environment. It’s a place where everyone can feel accepted.', 'I moved to Manhasset in March 2017 as an 8th grader, and it has been an extraordinary school experience. Manhasset Secondary School offers various excellent academic courses, clubs and sports. People in this school are generally very kind, and it is so safe that sometimes it even feels boring because nothing ""dangerous"" or ""unsafe"" happened here since when I transferred here. The school has interesting events and traditions, though. They have great smartboards, desktops and laptops. The counselors are also very kind and they willingly hear any student\'s issues, even if it seems so small. The staffs are highly aware of bullying and any kind of violence in school. Most teachers are very eager and friendly. One thing that Manhasset lacks of is diversity. I would say about 80% of the people are white. There food is slightly better than average, but I think it is overpriced. I always bring my own food from home.', ""Manhasset High School is a very competitive school as their SAT scores are around 1300s. Manhasset has a big emphasis on school sports as Manhasset's Lacrosse team is one of the best in the country. Many different AP courses are available to students. Recently, renovated the research department allowing for kids in research to get better experiments and results. Science research is one of the big points of Manhasset High School as Manhasset recently won prizes. Manhasset lacks diversity; however, this is getting better as more and more people of different races are moving into this predominately white neighborhood. Manhasset prepares its kids to go to college. Therefore, Manhasset High School is a great environment to learn and play sports, but Manhasset is lacking diversity other schools might have."", 'What I loved about my high school is that it was my home away from home. I was able to find things that I love and would continue as a college student. I loved the opportunities and experiences I had.

Other than that, the school is pretty good."", 'Mostly meant for kids who love to play sports, have a good time, and love to show off there status. When I went there the school was ok, some things are good and other things were bad. I fee like the teachers were sometimes robots and would read straight from the book. They were very much common core oriented, The class of 2016 was the experimental year of trying different methods of teaching and testing. Not a fun a time. Overall, my sophomore and senior year were the only good years of high school for me. Everything else was ok.', 'I loved my time at Manhasset High School! I now attend a highly competitive college, and I felt adequately prepared graduating from Manhasset.

Some of my favorite teachers to this day as a college senior are from Manhasset High School.', ""Manhasset is good educationally and socially it's a very accepting school. A lot of things can change, but some of the issues are just solved with age."", ""As a native US citizen whose parents are immigrants that came from overseas, I would love to see some more diversity in the student and teacher population. This may naturally take place over time, however, in the meantime there could be substantial progress in the departments of the celebration of diverse backgrounds as well as the general school spirit. Students' attitudes, as they are at most schools, are extremely negative towards school. The fact that this is an issue in schools across the board is no excuse for its prescence, and the administration must take appropriate actions. It may be considered naive of me, but I truly believe that school can be an enjoyable experience for all under the right circumstances.

However, I have also seen that it is very easy to fall through the cracks and not get the most out of your time at Manhasset.

There is a huge gap between students who really care about school and take all of the AP level classes and get really good grades and the students that simply pass through without getting the most out of their experience.

The school has interesting events and traditions, though. They have great smartboards, desktops and laptops. The counselors are also very kind and they willingly hear any student\'s issues, even if it seems so small. The staffs are highly aware of bullying and any kind of violence in school. Most teachers are very eager and friendly. One thing that Manhasset lacks of is diversity. I would say about 80% of the people are white.

Science research is one of the big points of Manhasset High School as Manhasset recently won prizes.

Those with a high GPA may consider themselves smart, but the people who know about the world around them are truly the smartest, because nobody is going to ask you obscure information you learned in high school 20 years after. Normal high schools in the movies and on TV show students having parties and going out, here that doesn't happen, just more studying instead.

The community embraced uniqueness and diversity in individuals rather than making people feel out of place for being different. There was a strong emphasis on growth in the school to the point where I did not have a difficult transition into college, whereas I know many students do. There was an ample amount of resources available through being a student there, such as access to databases and other important tools. Our music department excelled every single year, along with our improving sports program. The school allowed students to create their own clubs about almost everything that they wanted, giving students a chance to discover new interests.', ""It is a pretty fun place, although there is too much obsession over grades.

All the teachers are so kind and helpful while the students are so sweet and willing to help anyone that seems lost. I joined a sports team this year and it has been amazing. The Coach is so sweet and welcoming, she pushes us to do better and always encourages the team. All facilities provided are available to everyone and the district continuously works to better them.', 'Bad at sports which does relate to school spirit but school events usually make up for it. Could be more helpful to students with mental illness but they are taking action to improve. Overall I had a good school experience and education at Herricks and I was more than ready for college as a result of it.', ""Herricks High School is only a good place for you if you're an Asian kid who is willing to study 40 hours a week on top of homework, and not want to go out on a Friday or Saturday night, instead be in your room studying. Herricks is basically isolated from the rest of Nassau County, because it's practically a ghost town. We're terrible at sports because we promote academics way too much. Those with a high GPA may consider themselves smart, but the people who know about the world around them are truly the smartest, because nobody is going to ask you obscure information you learned in high school 20 years after. Normal high schools in the movies and on TV show students having parties and going out, here that doesn't happen, just more studying instead. The demographics are getting more and more Asian and less and less white. Starting with say the class of 2040, the school is probably going to be completely Asian."", ""Herricks is a very diverse school with a lot of great things to offer. Our teachers were pretty engaged for the most part and I had a few that were really good about challenging you to do stuff but not all of them.  Music programs were really good and so were our art teachers.  Volleyball and Football coaches were good and so were the girls coaches but our baseball coaches not so much. The overall staff was dedicated and willing to help but you have to make sure you seek it out.  My guidance counselor rarely helped out so it didn't feel like anyone was offering advice for getting in to college or help to get grades up until there was a problem.  Overall it was a great high school with plenty of community support and some great teachers. We also just had a new football field and track installed recently."", 'In one word: Asian. Herricks is extremely academically competitive and their main focus is to prepare students for college. Teachers are generally willing to help during both class and off periods.

Herricks High School felt more like a home to me than school. The teachers were extremely personal and aided individuals to do their best. The community embraced uniqueness and diversity in individuals rather than making people feel out of place for being different. There was a strong emphasis on growth in the school to the point where I did not have a difficult transition into college, whereas I know many students do. There was an ample amount of resources available through being a student there, such as access to databases and other important tools. Our music department excelled every single year, along with our improving sports program. The school allowed students to create their own clubs about almost everything that they wanted, giving students a chance to discover new interests.', ""It is a pretty fun place, although there is too much obsession over grades. There could be better food, as the hot lunch is pretty terrible. The budget should've also been used more for books, equipment and improvement of classrooms"", ""We've been living in the District for 15 years; my older 2 children went to parochial HS's and my youngest is currently a student at Herricks.  Far and away, Herricks has provided the better overall educational experience.

It is very diverse and the students are all very inclusive. The teachers are always available for extra help.  The guidance department was very involved in my college planning and I feel that I am very prepared for college.', 'The way teachers work here actually teaches you stuff of value unlike most schools. For most people school is a waste of time and I also agree with that. But school is not an option and we dont have any substitute for it yet.

As a violinist, I appreciate Herricks' especially strong music program."", ""Herricks high school's teachers genuinely try their best to have their students excel and legitimately understand the class material rather than just gain knowledge for one test only to forget about it later on.

In addition, there is not much diversity at the school. However, with all that being said, I think the pros of Staples definitely outshine the cons.', ""Staples is a great place for some and not so great for others.

Students are very intelligent and have great grades. Teachers give tons of work and lots of the students life revolves around school. However, this is good because it adequately prepares students for what is to come during college. Peter Willson, the college advisor, hosts a summer program after junior year which excellently readies students for the college process in senior year. In accordance to school culture, there are often dances every couple months held in the lunch room which are a good stress reliever from all the work. In addition, the school is somewhat diverse with most kids being asian, some white and or hispanic and very few African American students. One negative about the school is that there are few sports programs that students can attend because the school is very small (about 500 students).', 'Excellent school that prepares you well for college. Great teachers with high expectations. Excellent college counselor. Highly recommend.', 'As an incoming freshman, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I had never heard of BSGE before, other than from my parents. But how could a 14 year old teenager possibly believe what their parents say. The academic environment was extremely challenging at first. Not only were the people highly competitive, but the material was difficult. It required me to learn a different type of thinking. Unlike other public high schools, BSGE has the IB curriculum, which teaches its students to become critical thinkers, to question everything that comes their way. One thing this school did lack throughout my four years though was the availability of resources. The school building does not have an auditorium or gymnasium, so it is difficult to split activity space among clubs and the sports teams. Additionally, the sports teams that the schools does have receive barely any funding. I also do think the school could have more learning opportunities like research.', 'Teachers are amazing great.very few lucky student who ever get admission there.building is small but resources are great for student.', 'Baccalaureate is a very special environment.

Frequently, I found myself speaking to various teachers about their classes and as a result, building strong relationships with my instructors. With about 450 enrolled, class sizes are small thus allowing strong relationships to be nurtured. Furthermore, working towards the International Baccalaureate Diploma, I have learned a set of skills that are truly influential to my further studies in college. Going through rigorous assignments and having an idea of how to conduct extensive research are just two of the various skills that are incubated during an IB students career. Altogether, the rigorous academics and the wonderful social environment are two characteristics that I think make BSGE a phenomenal choice for students who are interested in intellectual growth and preparation for the real world.', ""In the Baccalaureate School for Global Education, students are hardly ever given  a break and this might be seen as negative to some but it really helps prepare us, the students, for college and life in general. It does suck that sometimes we can't participate in much clubs (due to the scarcity of them), and aren't given as much time for extracurricular activities due to our IB Diploma Programme, which is the program that all junior and seniors and enrolled in.

Nonetheless, the close community atmosphere can be nice.', 'This school helped me prepare for college very well. Courses were tough but made college doable. Wished it was funded more.', 'In terms of education, academic rigor, and college readiness, BSGE is at the top of its league. The teachers are for the most part knowledgeable, dedicated, and passionate about the subjects they teach. The small class sizes make forming personal relationships with your teachers much easier and more rewarding in the long term. It is important to understand that the academic rigor of the IB diploma programme is not to be taken lightly: I found that the school depleted my social life almost entirely over the course of 6 years. But to those that are hard workers and up to the challenge, this school offers everything that you need in order to succeed in college, and later on in life.', 'The motivation teachers have in helping their students succeed while creating a relaxed atmosphere.

I know that the staff and teachers will provide the resources and help for my success.', 'Baccalaureate School for Global Education is a great school for those focused primarily on academics. Students are very intelligent and have great grades. Teachers give tons of work and lots of the students life revolves around school. However, this is good because it adequately prepares students for what is to come during college. Peter Willson, the college advisor, hosts a summer program after junior year which excellently readies students for the college process in senior year. In accordance to school culture, there are often dances every couple months held in the lunch room which are a good stress reliever from all the work. In addition, the school is somewhat diverse with most kids being asian, some white and or hispanic and very few African American students. One negative about the school is that there are few sports programs that students can attend because the school is very small (about 500 students).', 'Excellent school that prepares you well for college. Great teachers with high expectations. Excellent college counselor. Highly recommend.', 'As an incoming freshman, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. I had never heard of BSGE before, other than from my parents. But how could a 14 year old teenager possibly believe what their parents say. The academic environment was extremely challenging at first. Not only were the people highly competitive, but the material was difficult. It required me to learn a different type of thinking. Unlike other public high schools, BSGE has the IB curriculum, which teaches its students to become critical thinkers, to question everything that comes their way. One thing this school did lack throughout my four years though was the availability of resources. The school building does not have an auditorium or gymnasium, so it is difficult to split activity space among clubs and the sports teams. Additionally, the sports teams that the schools does have receive barely any funding. I also do think the school could have more learning opportunities like research.', 'Teachers are amazing great.very few lucky student who ever get admission there.building is small but resources are great for student.', 'Baccalaureate is a very special environment.  The community is supportive and the teachers and students want you to succeed and thrive.', 'The academic experience at BSGE is beyond extraordinary. I am constantly challenged in all of my classes to be a critical thinker and am continuously supported by my peers and teachers. However, BSGE, due to its lack of funding, cannot provide many extracurricular opportunities that I would like and does not have funds for our own gymnasium.', ""Overall, this school provided me with an excellent understanding of the diversity of the world's populations and problems. The teachers and administrators were extremely intelligent and engaged individuals. The only drawback is the lack of resources/facilities such as a gymnasium or outdoor space!"", 'Being a student at the Baccalaureate School For Global Education since the 7th grade, I have encountered nothing but positive experiences from my time in the school. Frequently, I found myself speaking to various teachers about their classes and as a result, building strong relationships with my instructors. With about 450 enrolled, class sizes are small thus allowing strong relationships to be nurtured. Furthermore, working towards the International Baccalaureate Diploma, I have learned a set of skills that are truly influential to my further studies in college. Going through rigorous assignments and having an idea of how to conduct extensive research are just two of the various skills that are incubated during an IB students career. Altogether, the rigorous academics and the wonderful social environment are two characteristics that I think make BSGE a phenomenal choice for students who are interested in intellectual growth and preparation for the real world.', ""In the Baccalaureate School for Global Education, students are hardly ever given  a break and this might be seen as negative to some but it really helps prepare us, the students, for college and life in general. It does suck that sometimes we can't participate in much clubs (due to the scarcity of them), and aren't given as much time for extracurricular activities due to our IB Diploma Programme, which is the program that all junior and seniors and enrolled in. The school consists of really friendly students and teachers and if you stay on track with your work, chances are that you will excel."", 'The Baccalaureate School for Global Education is a very academically driven school however it lacks resources that could make the school better. While the curriculum itself is meant to be well done, the teachers and implementation of the IB curriculum is not always the best. Furthermore, the work hard culture present at the school can be mentally deteriorating. Nonetheless, the close community atmosphere can be nice.', 'This school helped me prepare for college very well. Courses were tough but made college doable. Wished it was funded more.', 'In terms of education, academic rigor, and college readiness, BSGE is at the top of its league. The teachers are for the most part knowledgeable, dedicated, and passionate about the subjects they teach. The small class sizes make forming personal relationships with your teachers much easier and more rewarding in the long term. It is important to understand that the academic rigor of the IB diploma programme is not to be taken lightly: I found that the school depleted my social life almost entirely over the course of 6 years. But to those that are hard workers and up to the challenge, this school offers everything that you need in order to succeed in college, and later on in life.', 'The motivation teachers have in helping their students succeed while creating a relaxed atmosphere. The aid the school facilitators offer further provide support for the students during stressful times. It is a small school but it allows you to know everyone there, like a little village.

I hope that the next few years will be even better!"", ""I like the closeness that the entire staff and student body feel towards one another.

Union County Vocational-Technical High School,"['The UCTech environment is competitive and driven. They offer a substantial amount of actual college classes correlated with Rutgers where we can earn college credits. This is mainly in the Clinical Care and Exercise Physiology academies. These academies take classes like; medical terminology, anatomy and physiology 1&2, scientific priniples of nutrition, intro to physical therapy, dyanmics of healthcare, intro to pharmacology, and much more.  School of Design, Sustainable Science, and Teaching Education Academies all go to Kean University their senior year of high school. The Law and Justice academy is also very challenging in which they take AP psychology, AP government, crime scene investigation, intro to the criminal justice system, criminal law and procedure, and more. Students in some of the academies have the opportunity to go on an internship their senior year too. UCTech challenges students academically and prepares them so well for college, like no other high school does.', ""This high school is a very unique experience. The work load is intense and the skills you will learn are invaluable. It's wonderful to be in such a close-knit community on this campus. The dual-enrollment program is difficult socially, but this high school prepares you for college well beyond the average student."", 'It is a great experience. They push their students to the limit through academics and extracurricular activities. For example, all students enter taking honors their whole time there. Multiple AP classes are offered and students are able to choose what vocation they want to major in and they receive specific experience and certifications from that specific career. There are even certain academies in which students attend Kean University their senior year, free of cost. They receive 30 college credits and they can get ahead on their college career. Without UCTECH, I would not be where I am today.', ""Honestly, if I didn't have my friends with me at this school I would suffer. The workload is lighter than the workload at other schools, but the overall material and curriculum is still pretty difficult. However, I do love the teachers at this school, as I've found them to be more laid-back and easier to talk to than the teachers I've had at other schools. I just wish there was more involvement and encouragement of extracurriculars like sports and music & arts."", 'Education is great and is a very safe place to be. Students are very focused and facilty is very helpfull in all all situations.', ""Theres no sports, the education was alright but depending on your course don't get any electives, and can't take advanced courses."", 'I attend the Academy for Information Technology at Union County Vocational Technical School. It is a wonderful place to have spent my high school years. It is a difficult school, but the students, teachers and administration are always supportive and willing to lend a helping hand.', ""I feel like I have gained an education from this school that I would not have received in any other. However, having such an academically rigorous school has set me back in other activities. I would like to see a system implemented where the administration keeps the students' personal lives in mind. Many students in our school suffer from mental health issues and our school does not seem to take it into consideration."", 'The five schools on campus are all very connected. You can explore a wide variety of classes at any school and meet new people from all over Union County.', ""When I came to UCVTS I was so ready to embrace this new environment. Previously, I had attended elementary and middle school with the same group of people so I was excited to see new faces and be challenged not only socially, but academically as well. Surrounded by the top students in Union County, it's easy to get intimidated, but the teachers make the transition a breeze. Now a senior, I can confidently say coming here was the best decision of my life thus far."", 'It is a good school. I really enjoy being a student there. I have made and I am still making great friends that will last me a lifetime. The education system is very great. I love it here', 'My experience with Union County Vocational Technical High School was one of happiness and great memories. The devotion to education and learning that the faculty and staff had there was so uplifting, making almost every day at school a refreshing experience. The teachers and administrators care so much about the students and they know exactly how to captivate their attention. I’ve made so many memories there as I grew as a student. I made lots of friends and had the time of my life. I’ll never forget it.', ""There's a reason why UCVTS is considered to be one of the best school districts in NJ. With its small class sizes, challenging honors curriculum, and amazing faculty/staff, there's no place quite like it. The UCTECH School of Design program has challenged me immensely, and has helped me prepare for a career in the arts. If you're considering any of the schools at UCVTS, I definitely encourage you to go to one of the information sessions to see the campus firsthand. I guarantee that you'll fall in love with it!"", 'Amazing honors high school. Amazing but very stressful coursework, teachers, and academies. Very nice, safe, clean, and college-like campus. Everyone is very committed because of the quite low acceptance rate.', ""Great, challenging school with a nice environment. Most teachers are able to build amazing relationships with students and always encourage them to work their hardest. I have enjoyed my previous years as a student in this high school. I especially like being able to move around between each building on the campus. However, this school has had it's fair share of problematic teachers and strange curriculum. Overall it is a much better choice than most district high schools."", ""What I absolutely loved about this school was the ability to make a choice in your future and stick to that path. I chose to go into the design field and it helped keep me on track to go into the same field in college. Things that I would like to see change are the ways of teaching. Some of the teaching materials and ways are very outdated and don't provide flexibility toward everyone's individual learning ability."", 'other than the principles giving me problems, my school is the most public high school out of the 5 high schools here at UCVTS. its super hard for students that were reading at a 12th grade level in 4th gradethis school made me cry and depressedbut ayygood job im smart ish', 'This school challenges students to do their best, it may not be like a typical high school but it is still a good school.', 'I believe that the rigorous coursework is beneficial towards preparing students for college. Because it is a campus, integration between different schools of engineering, business, medicine, the arts, and more has been an experience of diversity and open-mindedness.', 'UCVTS is a system of five high schools that share a campus and are all in close proximity to each other.

Though, despite this, HSAS has managed to be ranked the best school in the state on more than one occasion likely because of the school’s small and comforting community and because the students are overachievers. However, this is not to say HSAS lacks any drawbacks.  The most noticeable problem is likely the weak math department; while all the other departments in the school are exceptional, the math department in the school is, oddly enough, average and it shows on student’s regents scores.', 'I liked the sports and clubs that they offered.

Fairly average/weak math department. English is a mix: half are great teachers, half are terrible, no real middle ground. Also, limited activities/resources due to size, but if you make an effort you form closer relationships with teachers which can help with college. Counselor can be unhelpful (pushes SUNYs and CUNYs very hard) and gives vague advice.

Physics is great, and Chemistry is alright, but the AP class isn't awesome. Moreover, the math department is a joke, and the arts department doesn't exist. Also, the guidance counselor might be the worst person on the face of the planet. I want to be absolutely clear here, HSAS will make the college process a living nightmare.

The teachers love what they teach and hence, make an interesting class. They set aside time after school to help those who need help. As a relatively small school, we have great bonds with one another, forming a very close-knit and accepting environment. In summary, it is a school that is genuinely enjoyed and loved by students, faculty, and parents and highly recommended to prospective students.', 'I really enjoyed my years at HSAS. The students were very nice for the most part and for the most part teachers cared about students and worked very hard. But it did seem like some teachers were the absolute best and others were just awful. There was not a lot of guidance through the college process, which could be improved upon with another counselor to help out.', 'The High School of American Studies at Lehman College is one of the specialized schools in New York City (admissions through the SHSAT). It offers a wide range of courses, as well as AP classes. The teachers are amazing, and have been recognized by the New York Times for awards. However, the work load is heavy, and the school includes about 100 students per grade. It is a very small school, but many students are nice, and friendly. Students are also able to use the Lehman Campus facilities, and take college classes.', 'HSAS was the best, but also the worst. It’s a lot of work in a very competitive atmosphere, but the kids are very smart and interesting. Be prepared to have your self perceived level of intelligence shot down, a lot. One complaint Is that there should be some computer coding, hsas kids are learning like luddites.', 'HSAS (as the students call it) is a fairly small and unknown school right across the street from Lehman College.  As a matter of fact, the students from our neighboring school, Bronx Science, ask HSAS students what and where HSAS is, even though the schools are in a three block vicinity of each other.  Though, despite this, HSAS has managed to be ranked the best school in the state on more than one occasion likely because of the school’s small and comforting community and because the students are overachievers. However, this is not to say HSAS lacks any drawbacks.  The most noticeable problem is likely the weak math department; while all the other departments in the school are exceptional, the math department in the school is, oddly enough, average and it shows on student’s regents scores.', 'I liked the sports and clubs that they offered. Teachers were awful for the most part and rude. I’m glad I graduated and never have to go back.', ""It is an amazing school! The History and Science departments are very strong; They have amazing teachers, subject matter, and topics. I would say that the math department can be a bit stronger, but it still is amazing nevertheless. Because of the great teachers' efforts, I have done amazingly in all my regents and AP exams."", 'Teachers really challenge you to do your best. This is a great school to go to and the environment is pretty nice.', 'My experience at HSAS was definitely an enriching one. The teachers truly wanted their students to learn. Coming from a background where I was told I would not amount to anything by past teachers, I found strength and encouragement from the faculty. The courses were rigorous but I felt prepared for college. If I could change the school, I would change the demographics. As an under represented minority, I felt out of place. There have been efforts to diversify the student body which I truly hope continue.', 'Great academics, but not the best teachers, and terrible administration. The students are very intellectual and hardworking', 'My son is finishing his senior year at HSAS, and we could not be happier with the  education he has received. More importantly, perhaps, he has fostered good and lasting friendships, and HSAS deserves credit for creating an atmosphere in which strong social bonds thrive. Although this is a highly competitive school in terms of academics, students are not competitive with each other as might be expected. There is very little downside to this school, but the college counseling can be placed in that realm. I think most parents struck out on their own during that ""all important"" search. We were very careful in our search for an excellent school, particularly because our son had to commute a long way to come to HSAS, but we are very happy that he\'s had the high school experience that he has had here. Highly, highly recommend it!', ""High School of American Studies is an excellent school that has helped me so much in the transition from middle school to high school, and has also helped me feel extremely prepared for college.  It's very small, with about 100 students per grade, which can be a great thing because it feels like a family and all of the teachers know you, but can also be a con because it can feel too small at times. There also aren't as many options in regards to AP classes or language classes, but Lehman college offers a lot of college classes that are open to high school students.  Regardless, the kids are very smart and the faculty is very supportive.  I'm very glad I went here!"", ""Very close knit school with excellent teachers in the history department but subpar quality teachers in the mathematics department. Slightly lacking in clubs. Faculty is excellent overall, and if you try hard you'll do well."", 'I had a great time at the school but I was also lucky in terms of teachers and my ability to handle the workload. Your experience definitely depends on who you get for Math and English soph/junior year. Excellent history teachers, the strongest part of the school. Good science classes, but not for AP. Fairly average/weak math department. English is a mix: half are great teachers, half are terrible, no real middle ground. Also, limited activities/resources due to size, but if you make an effort you form closer relationships with teachers which can help with college. Counselor can be unhelpful (pushes SUNYs and CUNYs very hard) and gives vague advice. Personal experience went well, but many students struggle both with the workload and mental health due to the difficulty/stressfulness and unhelpful teachers/administration.', ""I love the community at the High School of American Studies at Lehman College. It's a very small school, and for that reason, most students get to know each other really well. This creates a strong sense of belonging, and I value that a lot. I do wish the school was more diverse, however."", ""As a senior, I'm glad I have had the chance to go to this school. This school pushes you to your maximum capability every day and makes you become both a better student and person. Everyone at the school is friendly and a feeling of a community is established. Everyone knows each other and you never feel alone."", 'It was nice to have a small community in which all the students knew each other however it was a very competitive atmosphere. Grades and numbers are definitely emphasized over mental health and resources for those who may suffer from depression/anxiety resulting from the pressure of the school are basically nonexistent.', ""I would say that academically it's a mixed bag. The history and english departments at the school are absolutely amazing, and probably the best anywhere in America. Having said that, the science department is a mixed bag. Physics is great, and Chemistry is alright, but the AP class isn't awesome. Moreover, the math department is a joke, and the arts department doesn't exist. Also, the guidance counselor might be the worst person on the face of the planet. I want to be absolutely clear here, HSAS will make the college process a living nightmare. I actually go to professional therapy it was so bad. I would say it ruined my entire high school experience, but there are many positive aspects of the school that shouldn't be forgotten."", ""While it is admittedly a small school, the High School of American Studies (HSAS) is a sleeping giant in New York City's secondary public education roster. The competitive nature of enrollment assures that the best and brightest of the City's youthful aspirants receive a place in one of the friendliest and rigorous academic institutions this side of the Pond. Most, if not all, of the teachers are professionals with not only several years of teaching experience under their belts, but also boast MBAs, Ph.

You would rarely find or have a teacher whom would actually care enough about you to give you advice or suggestions to raise up your grade. I understand this is an early college, but we are still high school students and Bard just overworks us to the point where we barely have lives outside school. Most of the teachers are also pretty stuck up. It is nice that they come from IVY league schools, but that doesn't mean they can teach and I don't think bard gets that. On my interview, my interviewer starts flexing over the number of teachers that came from Harvard, Yale, etc. but honestly, all I could think about is whether they can teach. Some teachers depend on you to teach yourself but then what is the point of going t school when I can just stay home and teach myself. Also, everyone who goes there knows the math department sucks, and it only started getting diverse in 2017-2019."", 'I am a senior at Bard and I received an amazing education.

The transition from middle school to this school will be tough being that the curriculum is extremely rigorous and accelerated.

The facilities are awesome and well-kept. The classes are really rigorous; all teachers know their stuff. Many will go out of their way to support their students and ensure students are performing well. However, even for outgoing people like me, some teachers seem intimidating and hard to get along with. All teachers care about their students but do definitely have favoritism and value communication with students. Relative to other top schools city-wide, cultural appreciation and diversity are strong. Clubs meet once a week or every other week - disappointing since in middle school extracurriculars were an hour daily. The clubs are cool but could be better. The homework load and stress remains a challenge, but if you don't procrastinate, it's okay. If you make the most out of the resources you're given (and make friends with upperclassmen!), then you will gain a lot from BHSECQ."", 'If you’re thinking about going here, you shouldn’t have to, because it’s a great school. The academics are great; don’t let the fact that it’s a humanities school scare you, because there’s a great STEM program offered too. It’s a small school (only about 600 students), so if you’re a student athlete, Bard probably isn’t the place for you to further your athletic talent; our sport teams are mediocre at best. The college program is great; they all say that it gets harder once you’re in the college program, but I think it’s the opposite. You get a ton of frees and the work load is manageable. The only downside I can think of is that the administration doesn’t fire teachers, even if they’re awful at their job. All schools have “those teachers” though, and while it sucks, I guess you can’t really avoid it no matter what school you go to.', 'Bard Queens stretched me academically to explore topics I had never learned about before in an engaging, thought-provoking environment that encouraged student discussion and seminar style teaching. The humanities program at BHSECQ is extremely good with amazing professors who are passionate about their classes. Science classes are also very strong at BHSECQ. They teach material that goes beyond what is taught in typical AP and IB classes at other NYC high schools. In addition, the Associates Degree received from Bard College is incredibly useful and can be transferred at your next institution.

You would rarely find or have a teacher whom would actually care enough about you to give you advice or suggestions to raise up your grade. I understand this is an early college, but we are still high school students and Bard just overworks us to the point where we barely have lives outside school. Most of the teachers are also pretty stuck up. It is nice that they come from IVY league schools, but that doesn't mean they can teach and I don't think bard gets that. On my interview, my interviewer starts flexing over the number of teachers that came from Harvard, Yale, etc. but honestly, all I could think about is whether they can teach. Some teachers depend on you to teach yourself but then what is the point of going t school when I can just stay home and teach myself. Also, everyone who goes there knows the math department sucks, and it only started getting diverse in 2017-2019."", 'I am a senior at Bard and I received an amazing education.

Most students are racist and entitled and think they’re better. But there are good support systems and if you make real friends it’ll be great. Science department is great and there is a huge variety of classes offered.

The facilities are awesome and well-kept. The classes are really rigorous; all teachers know their stuff. Many will go out of their way to support their students and ensure students are performing well. However, even for outgoing people like me, some teachers seem intimidating and hard to get along with. All teachers care about their students but do definitely have favoritism and value communication with students. Relative to other top schools city-wide, cultural appreciation and diversity are strong. Clubs meet once a week or every other week - disappointing since in middle school extracurriculars were an hour daily. The clubs are cool but could be better. The homework load and stress remains a challenge, but if you don't procrastinate, it's okay. If you make the most out of the resources you're given (and make friends with upperclassmen!), then you will gain a lot from BHSECQ."", 'If you’re thinking about going here, you shouldn’t have to, because it’s a great school. The academics are great; don’t let the fact that it’s a humanities school scare you, because there’s a great STEM program offered too. It’s a small school (only about 600 students), so if you’re a student athlete, Bard probably isn’t the place for you to further your athletic talent; our sport teams are mediocre at best. The college program is great; they all say that it gets harder once you’re in the college program, but I think it’s the opposite. You get a ton of frees and the work load is manageable. The only downside I can think of is that the administration doesn’t fire teachers, even if they’re awful at their job. All schools have “those teachers” though, and while it sucks, I guess you can’t really avoid it no matter what school you go to.', 'Bard Queens stretched me academically to explore topics I had never learned about before in an engaging, thought-provoking environment that encouraged student discussion and seminar style teaching. The humanities program at BHSECQ is extremely good with amazing professors who are passionate about their classes. Science classes are also very strong at BHSECQ. They teach material that goes beyond what is taught in typical AP and IB classes at other NYC high schools.

The teachers and the administration in general communicated frequently and well with their students and were very approachable.

What I really like about this school is that the teachers are always so willing to help, there are always additional resources that I could take advantage of, the community atmosphere is always present, people are really nice, and the school offers a variety of classes, and clubs.

Another thing is that with the new block schedule it is harder to find classes at the beginning of the year, so the school should set the student potal up with a schedule for each letter day so the student can find their class more easily. Although I like how the school also offers chromebooks many students damage them because they aren't being monitored.

Amazing principal & office staff!   Smaller teacher/student ratios & you will get to know everyone.  It’s a career academy with a rigorous curriculum that will definitely prepare you for college.  You can graduate with college credits.  I will graduate come June 2020 & I would make the choice to attend AAHS all over again.

But they spend their budget so badly, especially for how small the school is they could easily spend more on resources and the interior in general. With a class of only 85 students, giod luck finding actual friends that arent toxic. Oh yeah if you want food poisoning eat the chicken during lunch.

Some teachers were excellent and some teachers were less than satisfactory.', 'It’s a small (300 students at most) magnet public high school that will prepare you to further your education towards a career in the medical sciences.  It’s a National Blue Ribbon School several times already with the latest being in 2018.Great teachers that are willing to go out of their way to make sure you succeed.  Amazing principal & office staff!   Smaller teacher/student ratios & you will get to know everyone.  It’s a career academy with a rigorous curriculum that will definitely prepare you for college.  You can graduate with college credits.  I will graduate come June 2020 & I would make the choice to attend AAHS all over again.  I will be pursuing a future in medicine and AAHS has given me the perfect foundation to build upon.  I am grateful for the many opportunities that AAHS provides their students.  From hospital rotations to community-based partnerships, and mentorship, Thank You!  I would highly recommend the Academy of Allied Health & Science, Neptune.', 'Academically, this school has prepped me to my full college potential. However, class sizes are too small.', 'Allied has a rigorous curriculum. In the very beginning of freshman year, all students realize how much effort they must put into their classes. All students are extremely competitive, but they do help each other study. All students are very dedicated to school and they push each other to do their best.', 'If you get in, you probably feel accomplished and excited. Just know that everyone who goes to Allied is just as smart and at least as motivated as you are. In fact, a lot of students have their lives and careers planned out in detail. Nobody gets by on their intelligence. You have to work hard every day. You won’t have the same high school experience as your friends outside of Allied. But, you will be prepared for college. And, if you have a sense of humor, you will find plenty of things to laugh at... for instance, gym!', ""It is a great school with a lot of staff members willing to push you to succeed in addition to providing you with lots of medical opportunities. I'm glad I went there as it has given me a foundation in medicine I can build upon. The kids in the school are very friendly and open. While we could use more clubs, we have plenty of activities students can get involved with. Since it is such a small school I got to know many of my classmates very well. In a way, this school kind of feels like a big family. While there will always be a level of competitiveness, everyone works together to succeed."", ""Going to Allied was one of the worst mistakes I've made. Drugs are huge among every class but I guess it's high school, right? But the community within Allied is just toxic which makes it go a step further. Not that hard of a school other than the science courses honestly. But they spend their budget so badly, especially for how small the school is they could easily spend more on resources and the interior in general. With a class of only 85 students, giod luck finding actual friends that arent toxic. Oh yeah if you want food poisoning eat the chicken during lunch. Also the clubs arent actually real clubs for the most part... However pur science department is strong with great teachers. Good history department too. Everything else about this school really is trash."", ""I am a senior right now and I have to say, I wouldn't want my high school education to be in any other school and that's EVEN after I'm pursuing a future in Computer Engineering. Even when I realized that the medical profession wasn't for me, this school still went above and beyond to help me build my resume for this future. Sure there are some good and bad teachers, but there are far more amazing teachers than bad ones. I love this school and I recommend it to anybody hoping to apply soon. Good luck!"", 'Challenging but rewarding and I enjoyed reaching out and helping the community in multiple classes.

I would like to see change with the general education classes. I wish we could have taken tests to get more college credits for general education classes.', 'Not only is it an academically challenging school, but it teaches you so much about yourself and your goals as a professional. Coming in, I had only a small interest in a medical career; after nearly four years there, I know for a fact that I want to be a doctor. I do wish they offered more AP courses, but overall, I had a very good experience at Allied.', 'AAHS is a great school to explore the medical field and find out if you really want to invest your time and money into an area in medicine', ""When I applied to this school, I thought there would be a great community with people I can truly connect with. The community makes the school the worst educational experience here. Its all about making fun/bullying the nicest students everyday and getting into drugs, so if you get admission into this school dont go. Average amount of good teachers, so you are better off going to your local public school. I'm popular within the freshman, but the freshman class needs major reforms.
