I think this system of learning is more useful and fulfilling, as the projects are often highly individualized and therefore when you complete them, it feels that much more satisfying. The school is relatively  new, and as such, certain aspects (like the scheduling) are prone to being messy. Bronx Collaborative has some very talented and helpful teachers, and some lackluster ones. The administration can occasionally be unhelpful, rude, and arguably lazy. But if you focus on the good things, Bronx Collaborative is a fine school! It just needs more time to find its footing.', 'I liked the people that I was surrounded with throughout my years in this school. I would like to change the disorganization of this school because it has an affect on the students work.', 'Bronx Collaborative High School is a small school where help is all you receive. Good teachers, you are definitely treated with respect in every aspect. The administrators make sure you are able to get what you are missing if you need a little more push to get to that certain academic level.

I was surprised by how the students and teachers bond. There is no hierarchy between students and teacher. The teacher treat students equal respect and love and student treat teacher with respect and love. One thing I like about this school is that teachers are tend to be approachable and understanding. Most teachers here are patient and determined to teach students to their best capabilities. As a matter of fact, teachers here also hear out opinions from students and allows student to explore in what they want to do. However, some students abuse this opportunity.

We get to choose our classes and they are very interesting courses like Food Chemistry and Gentrification. We have Japanese and some students is Japanese class took an 11 day trip to Japan.

At times it can be unorganized, but to be truthfully honest this school does care for its students. I see teachers stay after school to help students if they even need help. If a student doesn't have a computer at home, they are allowed to stay after school in the tech lab to finish it. The teachers are the best, they explain things to you if you don't understand they ask about your day, they even remember small details you tell them. The school is very diverse, no really cares where you came from, they care more about you as a person. This school also helps you a lot when it comes to college. They help you fill out FAFSA and TAP. Honestly, in a few years, I feel like this school can grow."", 'I’ve never experienced the emotional issues until high school, not saying it’s a good thing but it’s better than being in the dark and surreal.', ""In Bronx Collaborative attending to that school was a different experience, it showed me that high school can be difficult but you can also have fun and enjoy your time there. Students show their identities and where they come from. The classes are not that bad but the teachers are excellent, they help the students prepare for college. In the school they don't do regents, they do big projects which can be very difficult.

Memorial High School is known for the student’s pride as a whole, whether in the football games or special events, we all came together as a school to support each other and have a great time. I’m proud of being a Memorial Tiger!', ""While some teachers are great with students and caring for the pupils' grade, most are not. It would be nice to see a change in teachers attitudes concerning the student's hard work. Also, juniors and seniors should have a greater exposure to college preparedness. Most students are first generation and have no idea when or how to begin researching colleges as well as applying for scholarships, financial aid and summer programs that could be beneficial when applying to college."", 'I liked all the english teachers I had and they offer some interesting classes that were fun to take. However, I would like to change their sweater policy.', 'I like how teacher help students in their lunch hours, even though they dont have to. what Memorial should improve its facility.', 'Memorial High School definetly helps me if I am ever in doubt, emotionally or academically. Staff make sure we are aware about college and what we need in order to succeed.', 'Good school but needs more improvement and dedication from the students. It needs more investment for better classes and preparation.', ""Memorial High School was ok. During my four years there, there were plenty of clubs to join, but I wasn't necessarily ready for college. They just recently added engineering courses and it would have been really helpful if it was there when I was there. The counselors are nice, but they don't help much. I almost couldn't graduate because I was suppose to take a certain elective that I had no idea about. The staff is nice, but a lot of students lack motivation. Also, there ware way too little pre-calculus classes. If you weren't the top student, it was hard to get into any upper level math classes."", 'I entered Memorial High School in September 2014. I had graduated 8th grade from a Catholic school in a nearby town. At first, I had not been exposed to so many different ethnicities and backgrounds. I had culture shock, even though I came from another town. I was in a school with no more than 500 students enrolled, we all knew each other\'s names and we were all friends. The amazing thing about Memorial High was the sense of family. My teachers had a huge impact on my academic career. I entered high school with some problems at home, and school was the one thing I would look forward to every morning. I was never a straight ""A"" student prior to my high school career. I entered Memorial High School, and I immediately excelled. All of my teachers saw a potential in me and when I saw my Final Grades for freshman year- I started believing it too.  My four years at Memorial High School have mentally and physically prepared me for college and my future endeavors.', 'I loved going to school for most of my high school career. I am a very hard working student and I feel like I made the best out of my time in high school by excelling to my fullest potential with the material that the school had to offer. I was ranked top 10 out of my senior class of roughly 480 students. However, I did not feel like I was absolutely prepared for college one hundred percent since I did not learn a lot of prerequisite material that I was required to understand before I took the tremendous leap from high school to college. I still love my high school and hope to go back one day to share some of my knowledge in mathematics and science.', 'My overall experience was good. I wish teachers would be less of friend and teacher more.  I wish they would better assist students with the college enrollment process.', ""I love memorial because its anti-bully and you can be anyone and act anyway. The food is very healthy and even the vending machine is. The thing that has to change is that they need to fix the tracks and the air conditioning because in the summer it's really hot."", 'It’s a average high school, nothing too crazy. The thing I hate about this school is that you have to test to get into honors or ap classes', 'It may not seem like much, but this school will suprise you a lot. You will be able to interact with fellow classmates, and you will always have your teacher helping you by your side every second of the way', 'They need more organization. The administration needs to at least listen to and have an open mind with their students. Too strict in the wrong areas.', 'This school was honestly horrible when preparing for college. Most teachers are there to help you but there are a couple that are complete trash. The trigonometry teacher especially, Mrs. Jameson. She does not teach and is extremely lazy. She also feels suprerior to the students.', 'I honestly loved the people and environment. In every city, they are local rivals. Here in West New York, our rivals were North Bergen and Union City. If I were to have the opportunity to change schools, I would stay right where I am. North Bergen is very known for fights. There would be fights in the hallways and even the bathrooms. Union City was very known for the amounts of gossip that travel through their hallways. And Memorial? Memorial had more bums and sleepy heads than ever. I would take bums over fighters and ""chismosos"" any day. Our students are very calm yet very out spoken. But I can\'t say I don\'t feel comfortable, because everyone is so welcoming. Of course every school has its faults. There is not one high school that is perfect except High School Musical.  But I can say my class are my wildcats. I am blessed to say I graduated from Memorial. I have made memories and friends for a lifetime here. And I wouldn\'t change that for the world.', 'Memorial high school is a great school. The teachers were always so insightful and ready to help with any problems or concerns you had. Teachers and staff always mad sure they were doing their best at giving students the best education possible. I never did join a sport at memorial but I knew memorial had one of the best football and track teams in the area.', 'I am an alumni of Memorial High School and it pains me to say that this school was underwhelming. it was underwhelming in the fact that it lacks in diversity, assistance, food, and environment.', 'I liked the most the diversity and the arts program.  There is not much guidance when it comes to college. One has to do it on your own.  The guidance counselors are not available.   There are many clubs and activities.  One club that I find useful  is the peer group.  Teachers tend to try to be friends with students at the level of feeling comfortable of using bad language and feeling free to take students phones and throwing them down stairs.I will not miss my experience at Memorial High School.', 'Memorial high school was a great high school. i learn so much from every subject in school .the teachers really care about you and want you to learn.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

I had my times with one or three teachers but I have overcame the bad part of them and starting to grow up. I really don't like the school but I need my education. This school can be better and clean up more plus get some new technology for the students to learn in the way of our future."", 'My experience in the school was great is a well manage school they  prepare you for college.

They're not the best but it's not the worst."", ""BTMF is an OK high school. The administration is very concerned about uniforms. They should be more concerned about books for our classes and supplies to use during testing. The only thing that I do like about BTMF is that I'm graduating this year to go to bigger and better things for my future."", ""I didn't like my experience at BTMF that much. The main thing I liked was meeting the people I am friends with now. I didn't want to come to this school but I had no choice but to come. I do not wish to pursuer a career in Business, Technology, Marketing & Finance  but if I did I would not recommend coming to this school. When you pick your pathway the whole point is to start focusing on that specific path you picked. Having only one forty minute class isn't going to get you ready for a career in that area of study."", 'My overall review of the school of Business, Technology, Marketing and Finance is it was better than I expected it to be. I came to this school because it was my only option but I ended up liking it. The experience I had in high school helped me grow as a person.', ""The School of Business, Technology, Marketing & Finance is an okay school. It have it's ups and downs but what school doesn't. They can improve there school by interesting there  lesson plan so students will enjoy going to class."", 'My experience in my school was okay.It was not as great like I would had like it to be.This is not that bad but it has a lot of problem evolving the student.Also what I would like them to do is fixed the school building form the outside and inside.', 'My experience in BTMF was poor. I was able to meet new people which is a plus however there is a huge lack of motivation in teachers and students. Overall the school lacks skills in many places.', ""The school of Business, Technology, Marketing and Finance is a very diverse school. When I was a freshman, this school was unorganized and students did whatever they wanted. Now as the years past by and that I'm a senior, the administrators have become more involved with the students and set some rules. This school has definitely progressed over the years. I feel as though the teachers have found a way to connect with their students even more for a better understanding of them."", 'My overall experience at the Academy of Business Technology Marketing and Finance, was a bitter sweet one.  At this academy I have grown and learned so many things with the help of lovely teachers. I have grown fond of some students as well whether we just socialize on class or we have a club or do  an activity together.  This academy have taught me  many life traits that  I seen suitable to carry over in the real world as soon as I have graduated.

Also, the strong minded and outspoken enter the debate team, including quiet students with loud minds that want to practice their public speaking. Lastly, an interesting club or rather an after school activity that was created by the fellow students would be the Geek Club. This club is filled with a variety of people who stay after school to catch up with each other, help each other out with school work, or simply find something random to keep themselves occupied. I believe this would be a favorite club of mine because the ones who found it were simply a bunch of students who didn't consider themselves popular but welcomed anyone who wanted to find a place to socialize after school. Even though there isn't anything particularly glamorous about these clubs compared to other suburban high schools, i still applaud my school for its efforts and time to do something for the students and help guide them into educated, level-headed individuals coming from an urban city."", 'the teachers were very good and helped each student in different ways.

The school goes the extra mile or miles to help their students. The school is very clean. The school offers a lot of resources for their students as well as for the Parents. From IEP, college prep, Sat prep, immigration and etc.', 'Being a senior at Law, Government and Justice has prepared me for the real world! I went to LGJ as a sixth grader, ever since then I became very close to the staff and I would always get pushed to do better just to become college ready. Being in school where the environment is great and challenging makes you feel like you are home. One thing I love that this school has provided is College and Career Prep for seniors. Being a senior is stressful especially when you really do not know how to even start your FASFA or CUNY applications! This class is just an extra boost to guide us with everything though college applications and after college!The one thing I think this school should improve on is just the food. Even though the fruits are good at breakfast and lunch!', ""My experience overall was average and enjoyable.  I learned what I had to learn and I did all the work that I had to do. There are some school rules that of course are hard to get used to or follow, for example, you can only use the bathroom during certain times and most of the time most of the bathrooms are locked so you can't even go to the bathroom at all. That makes it a little bit hard especially when you have an emergency. but in terms of the academics and teachers, They helped me learn a lot of things and also my favorite thing about the school is that they help prepare you for college. They have a lot of college visits and the emphasize college a lot which is really encouraging especially to those who are confused about the process of actually going to college."", 'This school has a lot of room for growth. There were a little AP classes in the high school. Administration seemed more focused on uniform rules than education. They cut out some programs like credit recovery which was beneficial to those who needed it. I did not feel challenged.', 'The counselors in the school do everything to help students improve their grade and better understand their decisions regarding their education..The stuff helps you get on your feet.', 'My experience at this school was not a bad one , but the help I received towards finding the colleges of my choice and being encouraged as a young student could definitely been better and could still improve for future students that are to attend. The school itself was always clean and the food was okay most of the time and the professors were great !', 'I think they did a good job preparing me for college, but my classmates were not very good in fostering a learning environment.', 'The Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice is working towards creating a better academic environment for students. There used to be little to no advanced placement courses, but there now are. Soon not just seniors will have the ability to take AP classes. The school is also recognizable by achievements in extracurriculars such as sports. Some track runners are recognized by the city. The girls volleyball team is undefeated with nine wins. The debate team has trophies lined up in cases in the lobby.', 'The teachers show a big interest in helping students in and out of the classroom. School is kept clean.

The school nurse does her job and nothing more, which isn't always the best. We have a few good health classes. We're a very small school and don't have room for more classes, let alone the funding it. The highlight is an EMT training course.

Students within this club experience the competition and journey of state level activities with kids from around New York. In addition, it looks great on college applications, and it gives students basic knowledge of medical terminology. Lastly, writers group, Thursdays  @2pm with Mr. Ragazzi is a nice thing to have for students to express their writing ability and imagination. The teacher, Mr. Ragazzi loves his job and actually had a short story published. He takes pleasure in listening to the creative writings of students. It is very interesting."", ""Phones aren't allowed in school, therefore the social scene is low. Not much peer pressure besides those who cut classes and school together. From there on I wouldn't know further peer pressure because I get to class and have never cut any of classes. Students are accepting, for the most part. Lesbians are accepted, and all religion, except for the occasional male homosexual orientation."", ""We do have HOSA, health organization students of america. If your looking to be in the medical profession, this teaches you medical terminology and more. The school tied students to St. John's internship. Also there are around 4 health centered courses, which are armature but something. There are good amount of college classes and courses available which is very interesting and allows for great opportunities. I am sure most highschools are like this, but I wouldnt know. This school makes great effort on extended academics once students apply for them. Regular classes however are a joke. I stay above a 90 and do not wish to go further above a 95 because most classes are too easy. Unless a teacher grades unfairly or poorly, it is easy to get a 90 average, however it won't help for college life.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""The school security guards mostly hate their jobs, in exception to a few. The scanners work, a little too good actually, causing students to get scanned after passing the scanners.The guards do their jobs in the morning, and are very strict on phones and kids who bypass the scanners. However, after school, the security at the school is low. This is because sometimes, only bags are scanned, but not your person for metal objects. One can infer the potential catastrophe of this. When there are fights, the guards go running, which is good, and safe, but that leaves the school vulnerable because most of them on a two floor radius go. The nurse is extremely neat and clean, newly renovated. It is part of North Shore LIJ, and they do their job perfectly, better than my family physician. Great job to them. Once a girl complained of her head hurting and the nurse gave her snacks, very nice of her. They honestly love their jobs. The nurse's office is for the entire building, which has 4 schools within."", ""To my knowledge, apparently Academy of Medical Technology was founded 7 years ago. I personally don't believe the school staff are prepared for the intake of kids in recent and future years. The school is on one floor and branches into several rooms on the 1st floor and in the section of Kappa, the school next door. I know high school and middle school should be separate, but they are on the same floors, just with different schedules, except in the morning, so these two grade ranges don't mix. Because of this, only 3/4 of he second floor is for high school, making transition to class very crowded and hard. Freshman year to senior year, I've witnessed more and more kids. On another note, the guidance counselor (called Ms. Wap) is not efficient. I believe that because there are so many students that once your schedule is given to you she doesn't prefer to change it. I personally went to her and told her that I wanted a first period class Junior year, but she told me no to take it easy since I have hard classes. I insisted further but agreed, to my surprise my Spanish teacher told me I should have been in her class. Many students complain about their schedule, and I believe it is because she gives students classes the state requires them to take a certain year and fills the rest with electives leaving them to fend for important credits later on. Schedules are 'messed up' always with not as much fun electives to choose from. \r Mr. Merced, the principle, is a very nice guy, hard working, honest, and caring, honestly, along with all other faulty members. Mrs. Chavez, is the only exception. She should have her teaching methods reviewed because  most of the class is based on her personal stories.\r There are no policies on bullying, from my view as a student, maybe just the inference not to do it. Lastly, the uniform policy is strict, however I do understand uniform improves the conduct of high school children. I believe this school will be over all better in the future."", ""the school resources isn't bad it's just not enough resources for every student to use. the tutoring is really well , there is tutoring for every regents class like English Algebra Global etc."", ""I say it's great because I've been at this school since it started so I've gotten used to all of it and know all the teachers that were there when I was in 6th grade.

The fan support is insane when it comes to male sports, female sports-not so much. Students are really supportive of athletics too. They love to cheer their friends on.', ""To be honest, with out extra curricular activities most the students at that school would not be there. The sports and the extra help create an environment for students that they may not have otherwise. There's something for everyone, and no matter what activity you're in you enjoy yourself."", ""As far as academics go, classes are split between honors, remedial, and advanced placement. If you are in honors all your classes are honors. The teacher might test you by giving you a little bit of a struggle when it comes to having things due at the same time, but it teaches you time management. The work load is nothing you can't handle, even though while your in the moment you're stressing, in the end when its over you feel really good. Teachers are usually all on one accord, and guidance counselors help you with scheduling so that your school year can go as smoothly as possible."", ""Our school is very diverse.

It's pretty cool to be honest."", ""Security at school was good, but mostly because the students weren't fighting each other in school or bullying. There may have been a few instances from time to time, but nothing like it was in previous years or in other schools. As far as drugs and alcohol, it's another thing that kids do outside of school."", ""To be honest no one likes cafeteria food. There's always the same things and you can clearly see when they've  taken day old taco meat and try top turn it into spaghetti. They had a choice of either a sub/wrap, chicken patty/cheeseburger, pizza, salad, or a hot food which looked pretty scary most of the time. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that great either."", 'For some people school is hard, for others it\'s easy. Everyone is different and everyone learns in different ways. To answer the question, ""Did Lakewood high school prepare you for the real world?"", I would say yes. I feel like every student had that one staff member, no matter what their job was, who was there for them and guided them when they needed it. When it comes to education, the students who wanted to learn did just that, they learned all they needed to and they got good grades. Those who didn\'t want to learn would play around, but everyone had an equal opportunity.', ""In Lakewood High School, my graduating class endured what seemed to be the wildest roller coaster of all time! We endured an enormous amount of changes in only four years. We were constantly in and out of dress code, guidance counselors would change from year to year, and every year we had a new principle, yet we made it through. As for the teachers, I commend them. They went through the changes that we did and they stayed with us. Although some students may give them a hard time, the teacher are the one constant thing we had. As far as my last year of high school went, I was pleasantly surprised. Our principle, Marcy Paturzo, was absolutely AMAZING! -as was the rest of our assistant principles. But i couldn't finish this review without giving credit to one really important person at that school, Our assistant principle Douglas Riley, the only principle who was with us for all four years. The students and staff grew closer trying to fight adversity. Some students have created such a relationship with the staff that they consider them family, which I believe is very special. Lakewood High school Is a very unique school,but it wouldn't be anything without it's staff."", ""As far as extracurricular activities go, my school has a variety of after-school clubs, that anyone can get involved in. We don't exclude anyone from anything. For instance, if a girl wanted to join the boys Tennis Team, there wouldn't be anything obstructing that from happening. The reason I say this, is because my best friend was that girl, she spoke out and in turn, received a gift from this school; acceptance. I am the most committed to my school's GSA club. It is where students straight, gay, or anyone who is just eager to learn about this society come to. It is where friends are made, and secrets can be kept. Aside from that, I like to take part in just about every club in my school, which involves; the National Honors Society, the Academic Team, Art Enrichment Club, Art Service Club, Cooking Club, Drama Club, the Yearbook Club, Future Business Leaders of America Club, Library Club, R.E.W.I.N.D(Reaching Everyone With Interactive Discussion)  History Club, German Club, and Spanish Club. I am president of FBLA, Stage Crew, Art Club, German Club, and I am my school's Stage Manager for Drama Acts as well. I am also involved in my school's Tennis, and Volleyball team. So obviously, Extra-Curricular Activities are a very prominent part of my life."", ""Our teachers really care about the students and want them to achieve not only in the classroom, but in the real world. Most teachers require us to take notes and use computers to find information. The teachers have an excellent knowledge about the subject their teaching so it's important to ask them for help. As a student, my communication skills have gotten better because our teachers require us to present our projects in front of the whole class which is important because that benefits you when you enter the workforce."", ""The guidence counselors are always there for you. They will help you with your class scheduling, college choices, and even personal information. For busing we have pleny of transportation. We have buses as soon as school ends, then theres buses for afterschool programs, and buses for students who are involved in athletics that need a ride home when it's dark outside. Over the years our technology has definitly improved. We now have Apple computers, chrome books, ipads,and mac books. In the classroom, our teachers don't even use the black board anymore, we now use a smart board which is an electronic board that helps teachers teach the students."", 'At our school, the students are very diverse.

Some of the students have a sexual orientation, but the students are accepted here. At our school, we socialize with anybody no matter what.', 'In the cafeteria, they have a variety of salads you can pick from. They give you a small portion of food. For their assorted subs, they used to use white bread and now they switched to whole wheat bread. Instead of cooking french fries they switched to sweet potatoe fries instead. Depite, all the healthy foods we have, our cafeteria still has vending machines that sell chips and beverages.', 'Our school administration had been through alot in all my four years in high school. We had a new principal each year, but this year with the new additions, the students are now succeding academically and the teaching improved. We still have a dress code incase students try to dress any type of way.

The school itself is well built and maintained, but some of the teachers and staff are unbearable. The guidance office is a very unwelcoming environment, in which you are usually not wanted in and a handful of teachers do their best to try and impose their beliefs on you. If the answers to your work do not line up with their beliefs, you will not get a satisfactory grade. I've even seen a teacher see a student get bullied in the middle of class, and instead of stopping it, joined in, making the student cry. Although, I cannot take away credit for the good teacher such as History and English. I learned a lot and my skills have been strengthened in history and writing. The lunch is also much better than the middle school lunch. Bigger variety, although a good portion of it is not made well."", 'My overall experience with this school is fantastic. As a current senior, I can definitely say that the memories of this high school will never fade. From a variety of clubs to diverse sports to take, the extracurricular activities never seem to be a burden. Instead,they are joyous pastimes that makes time fly meanwhile benefiting with educational matter. the courses offered in this school can vary a bit more, but the current type of courses should be more diverse. The courses with art aspects is limited and with more creative classes, the students might be able to be more involved in the school. The reason why the students would be more involved is for the fact that the art classes would motivate the students to participate in events hosted by the school. Other wise from that, the academic programs and extracurricular activities are pretty encouraging and beneficial to the students in numerous ways.', 'Roosevelt High School guides you towards college and preparers you for college.

I do not give full credit to RHS for the decline in gang violence and increased performance of the school. Over the years and gang violence has started to fade away due to the new peaceful generation of kids. The new generation kids that come from better homes have been produced in this neighborhood over the last years, which lead to less violence, less distractions and better scores overall. RHS definitely deserves the recognition for some of the amazing teachers that do an extraordinary job everyday.

This school taught me a couple things, if you want something fight for it and show your passion, don't ever take one persons advise, and surround yourself with who you want to be. What makes this school unique is that it's small, Roosevelt is a small town, so we basically grew up together. Entering high school with people you knew since pre-k helps the settling in process and helps with less student friction, but of course at every high school there is a steaming hot head waiting to start trouble. I would choose to attend this school all over again because it helped me realize that high school is a safe and great place to be.

Your school should be that great if you'd want to spend more hours then you have to in it."", ""This school is going on a great path from where it was to where it is now is astonishing. It's up to the student to know whether they want to learn or not. You can get the worlds greatest teacher to teach a student but if they aren't dedicated then there's the issues. From my own eyes I saw a teacher that was stressed from home related issues and still had the strength to teach students that were disrespectful, disruptive, and naughty. They care and if you find one that you feel doesn't, you can see that; yes there may be a lack of dislike with the students personality but never with the work that must be put in. The teachers here never mix their feelings of a childs behavior with how they will teach them. They make everything equal and fair.

The lunch is also much better than the middle school lunch. Bigger variety, although a good portion of it is not made well."", 'My overall experience with this school is fantastic. As a current senior, I can definitely say that the memories of this high school will never fade. From a variety of clubs to diverse sports to take, the extracurricular activities never seem to be a burden. Instead,they are joyous pastimes that makes time fly meanwhile benefiting with educational matter. the courses offered in this school can vary a bit more, but the current type of courses should be more diverse. The courses with art aspects is limited and with more creative classes, the students might be able to be more involved in the school. The reason why the students would be more involved is for the fact that the art classes would motivate the students to participate in events hosted by the school. Other wise from that, the academic programs and extracurricular activities are pretty encouraging and beneficial to the students in numerous ways.', 'Roosevelt High School guides you towards college and preparers you for college.

I do not give full credit to RHS for the decline in gang violence and increased performance of the school. Over the years and gang violence has started to fade away due to the new peaceful generation of kids. The new generation kids that come from better homes have been produced in this neighborhood over the last years, which lead to less violence, less distractions and better scores overall. RHS definitely deserves the recognition for some of the amazing teachers that do an extraordinary job everyday.

This school taught me a couple things, if you want something fight for it and show your passion, don't ever take one persons advise, and surround yourself with who you want to be. What makes this school unique is that it's small, Roosevelt is a small town, so we basically grew up together. Entering high school with people you knew since pre-k helps the settling in process and helps with less student friction, but of course at every high school there is a steaming hot head waiting to start trouble. I would choose to attend this school all over again because it helped me realize that high school is a safe and great place to be. For me I'd rather go to my school and do a little more work then be on the streets walking around or playing. Your school should be that great if you'd want to spend more hours then you have to in it."", ""This school is going on a great path from where it was to where it is now is astonishing. It's up to the student to know whether they want to learn or not. You can get the worlds greatest teacher to teach a student but if they aren't dedicated then there's the issues. From my own eyes I saw a teacher that was stressed from home related issues and still had the strength to teach students that were disrespectful, disruptive, and naughty. They care and if you find one that you feel doesn't, you can see that; yes there may be a lack of dislike with the students personality but never with the work that must be put in. The teachers here never mix their feelings of a childs behavior with how they will teach them. They make everything equal and fair.

I would say what makes the school a good school is the programs it has. I can say because of the programs students are engage but with school work they are slightly uninterested. Tutoring is offered after school and on Saturdays for students who need extra help academically with their school work.  The school has some glows and grows but still needs to improve to help students become the best they can be."", ""It's a okay school. I came here because I was new last year eighth grade  when I came to America. I am a current freshmen and am thinking of changing my high school.

Safety is really good here. They give a lot of college readiness for seniors at all times. Saturdays are also days for tutoring. The principal is involved in everything and cares a lot about our concerns. There is a diversity of teachers also that very much care about your grades. Clubs are a very good list to choose from here also, a little bit of everything. Just like sports will get you even more involved in school because for you to get in you have to have good grades.', ""The extracurricular opportunities at this school are okay.

I am currently taking a college prep class which i think is really helpful. The sports teams are very excellent, specifically baseball and softball.', ""My overall experience at this school is not great. The attendance rate is very low. There are physical fights between students nearly almost every day and i am not exaggerating at all. Most of the students at this school can care less about the school or of their work. Some of the students are very disrespectful towards not only their peers but the teachers as well. The setting of the school is disgusting - the school is filled with garbage and various odors. I wouldn't choose this school because not only the students are careless but the teachers are as well, and i can argue that the teachers do not challenge us enough to be better students."", ""I honestly believe that the teachers at my school do not challenge the students hard enough. What i mean is that the teachers give us work where the answers are right in front of us so its easy to pass the class, and if you don't pass the class it's because you're a careless student who doesn't do their work. Overall the teachers are very friendly with the students and they're easy to approach and comforting to talk too. If you're not doing your work the teachers care less because there is nothing they can do about it which is probably one reason why the graduation rate at my school is so low. I see no difference in the teaching styles between all teachers, i think they all teach in the same style which tends to get boring and us students use the same techniques for almost every class subject."", ""There is not much to do after school except for tutoring.  The clubs and after school activities have practically vanished.  There is no incentive to stay engaged in this school because students aren't rewarded for their efforts."", 'The school tried their best but being a NYC high school had its limitations. Teachers were required to teach to the regents, there was very little initiatives and very poor parent involvement.  There was a tremendous drop out rate.', 'Some teachers do go above and beyond but some do not care about their teaching.  Their lessons are boring and do not put anything into the lesson but the bare minimum.', 'What made the school unique for me was the friends I had and the nice teachers who pushed me to strive for more and when I had a slip up I had someone to talk to.', ""The interest of teachers at HSHCS is to help all students excel through the lesson , every teacher has a different teaching skill but HSHCS try to have multiple teacher just in case you cant work with one you can move to another teacher if its  possible.

Throughout the school year, Children Aid Society will give us internships and jobs so we can get glimpse of experience of the real world and how to get ready for it.', ""Unlike other schools, Opportunity Charter School gave me a chance to feel great, as I was in elementary school i really didn't get one on one attention like the staff in Ocs. Ocs staff makes me feel like I'm in a family that supports me every time I step through those doors"", ""Teachers in Opportunity Charter School, is there for students 7 days out of the week.

However, I do feel as if this school could have given the young the students a class where they learn how to do real-world activities. For example, home economics would be a perfect fit, even though it's a tight budget. If it were up to me, we should have classes where we learn how to buy a car or a house, and maybe learn to cook for the kids who may not know how to.

On the upside, I like the environment of when I first arrive at school, the principal is always outside greeting the students."", ""University High School was overall terrible. The majority of the teachers didn't teach, give assignments or help me learn anything overall. The school is very nasty; there were always cockroaches and rats in the cafeteria and locker room. Some of the teachers care but majority teachers acted like they didn't have the degree."", 'Entering high was a huge change from elementary school. At first I was not used to the huge hallways, students bigger than me, the teachers not as friendly, because everything was more serious and efficient than elementary school.

Harlem Renaissance High School,"['This school is one of the best transfer schools you can attend.

I no long feel small nor alone. Due to my experience there I learned how to grow intellectually into the young women I am today. The staff and teachers are not but a great help to the community and provide me and my other classmates with everything needed in order to succeed. Before coming to this school I had no desire on going to college and saw myself going down the wrong path, however now that I have been in this school for the past year or so it’s been nothing but blessings. One thing that I do hope to see change in over the course of the years is the no going outside for lunch policy. I feel that as mature young adults we should be able to go outside for lunch and know that coming back to class should be our number one priority throughout the day. It is known to be a responsibility.', 'My experience at attending Harlem renaissance was an wonderful experience , this school was very helpful I entered this school in September 2013 with 6 credits and 0 regents I graduated June 2016 with 44 credits and 5 regents now I am looking to attend "" Georgia state university "" but I don\'t know where to start', 'I liked how the staff is so friendly and willing to help. The diversity of foreign students always so eager to learn. I also enjoyed how rewarding it  is to get good grades by showing up and doing your work. The school is very helpful when it comes to college readiness. There are many college trips and events encouraging student to want to do better and enroll. It would be better if the attendance percentage was higher.', 'As a studen I would like to see more people engaged in their classes and take the core values into value and be eager to learn.', 'My expiercence at Harlem Renaissance high school Is Great. The teachers help to motivate students to do their best. Its a safe environment to be in.', 'The teachers at this school are very helpful and outgoing they make sure they do they job to help a student understand and get where they need to be. The teachers also communicate with students very well except for the students who likes to b jerks and act a fool / be the class clown.', ""The academics offered at this school such as A.P English classes , People you can talk to when you're going through things , people to talk to about your health , lunch classes and after school classes for credits and regent prep. The teachers are very helpful and if you are behind in work the teaches give you a workload of work to be due within two days or work to make up and if not then you fail on you chance because you were given another chance / opportunity. Close to regent time there is an after school class for regent prep there are also lunch classes for regent prep and credit recovery ."", 'There is a lunch program instead of going to lunch Ms.Allison invites an lady from mount Sinai to come teach and talk about health and peer pressure and what people go through in relationships , depression and etc. This class is called "" The Lunch Health Class "" and the credit goes / count for whatever you are missing gym or health.', ""The extracurricular opportunities at this school such as the CB units is a combinations of everything such as karate , art , music , dance , etc . These opportunities goes as electives credits or as any credit you're missing depending on which CB unit you pick."", 'If I had to do it all over again yes I would attend this school and just work on my attendance. This is a good school and they actually give you the opportunity to rebuild , renew , and restore ! Everyone in this school are very helpful and make sure they do their job to get students to graduate.', ""The teachers at Harlem Renaissance High School are very helpful to their students and outgoing for their students. The teachers tell you what you need and what you need to get done to get out of the school. The teachers does a good job teaching they explain step by step and if a student doesn't understand they go over it multiple times with the class until a students gets it even after explaining to the class multiple times the teacher will come over to the student and explain to make sure the student understand . I went into Harlem Renaissance High School with 6 credits and 0 regents , I left out with 44 credits and 5 regents . It's the best school ever I'm going to miss this school"", 'Overall this school is what you make it . Just get in and get out , making friends is not a wise decision because most students here are going to slow you down. Its an alternative school and most students who attend are in their 6th , 7th year of their high school career , have children , have been previously incarcerated or kicked out of their old schools. This is not a school you should expect to go to and have a real high school experience. You have to lock up your cell phone when you come in , surprise metal detectors some days , NO SPORTS TEAMS , its just basically a last resort school for people who have no other options and need something quick placed in the middle of the hood. Teachers choose their favorites and if you\'re not one you\'ll be treated less , kids make fun of other kids , the student body is basically divided by race except the few ""nerds"" who get in where they fit in or sit alone . dont come here for anything except to stay to yourself and make it out . VERY EASY A\'s , you get alot of credits per semester can make it out very quickly.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,,,

What I enjoyed about the school was the different after school activities that they offered. The clubs I really enjoyed were the crochet club, moot court and mock trial. Even though the school had good after schools activities however they lacked of treating the students like we were students other than money fro the state. Teachers had to pay out of pocket to buy us stuff and when I was in the 12th grade every student had a mandatory full schedule. A lot of students were giving classes they did not need. A teacher told me that the new principle did that to us because the school receive money with every class a student is taking.', 'I do have to say that my experience has been very positive...although not one of the top rated schools, I applied myself so that I can be a top rated student.

They smoke and participate in gang activities. This school is not safe for students who care about their education."", 'What I like about Cobble is its college readiness for its students.

From the classrooms to the teachers, the learning experience I have been able to go through was tremendous help and has led me on a path where I am destined for greater things. Although, the work may be tough, the teachers are understanding enough to make sure that all of their students are on the same level of comprehension in order for everyone to succeed in that learning environment.', 'At Cobble Hill high school my experience was ok and it could definitely have been better. What I enjoyed about the school was the different after school activities that they offered. The clubs I really enjoyed were the crochet club, moot court and mock trial. Even though the school had good after schools activities however they lacked of treating the students like we were students other than money fro the state. Teachers had to pay out of pocket to buy us stuff and when I was in the 12th grade every student had a mandatory full schedule. A lot of students were giving classes they did not need. A teacher told me that the new principle did that to us because the school receive money with every class a student is taking.', 'I do have to say that my experience has been very positive...although not one of the top rated schools, I applied myself so that I can be a top rated student. I did my best knowing that my education was my top priority. I had some really great teachers who had my best interest at heart and wanted to ensure that I was successful. I am graduating with an over 85 average and that I am very proud of.', 'Staff was beyond helpful to me as a transfer student. The atmosphere was welcoming. I would like to see more diversity in the type of teachers and implementation of new programs that will help high school students focus on their future career path early.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['My experience with cobble hill high school was good.

Academy for Urban Leadership Charter School,"[""This school is still new compared to many other high schools. Because of this, trial and error seem to be the method they use every year in order to figure out what's best for the school. They tend to be unorganized and messy. Despite that, there is passion and love in everything they do. The administration, faculty, and students have a family-like relationship."", 'The teachers there are great, they really try their best. However, the administration (the board) really does not care about the students and rarely listens to them. The size is both a good thing and a bad thing. Everyone knows each other so there is a sense of community, but the school is so small that we had to go to another building to eat lunch.', ""In our town, there used to be only one high school. Since everyone was mixed in with each other, it would be easy to get lost in a sea of students. However, when my parents heard of AUL, they didn't think twice to enroll me. Charter schools such as this focus on college readiness, and provide many events and resources to help their students plan for their future careers. If I could change anything, I would say that the school would run more efficiently if they focused on fixing and improving their internet access (and have more than one tech person on call)."", 'Avoid this school at all costs. Students threaten teachers and administration looks the other way. There is no salary guide and a first year teacher makes more than an experienced one. Also, there is no motivation to want to do good when all you receive is threats and paycuts.', ""The experience wasn't good, because the school has just started becoming a school. The education was okay, but needed better teachers."", 'I was part of the first graduating class for this high school and I truly loved my experience here. I am a now 22 year old young lady who now reflecting back can say I had wonderful teenage experience thanks to this charter school. Teachers were available any time after or during school hours, grading was college level which truly prepared me for Montclair State university where I attend school now, I made true life long friendships, was provided an internship opportunity, and attended/volunteered for several after school activities, on top of the many class trips I went on (technology services at Apple in NYC, Empire State Building, Rutgers University, Montclair University, etc.)', ""The school is great there are flaws but if you look beyond them you'll she the good things the school has to offer"", ""It was terrible the school wasent really a school it needs to be fixed it lacks a lot of things textbooks desks classrooms it's way to small and teachers don't really teach"", ""Although the school wasn't great, it was a very diverse school and small as well where you know almost everyone. they have great sports team and few great teachers"", ""It's a small school where you know everyone and we all work as a team to show leadership. The teachers are amazing they know what they are doing. This school consist of students joining a lot of activity after school and during school. Aul has shown me to be more confident and also it made me prepare for college. I would totally recommend this school for any students that would like to be in a small environment to learn quick and better."", ""When I started in this school there wasn't enough classrooms so sometimes learning would be hard due more then one class in the auditorium. But teachers would make the best from any situation. So many fun events and fundraisers that we did will always be remembered. This is school is unique because its about becoming a leader thinking about our future not only for our self but our whole community and class. You learn leadership skills and become a better person within. Learn not to be a boss but a leader!"", 'The teachers really try to work with they have and make the best to teach the students, as well include life lessons to make have a more understanding of our environment and society. The teachers are very helpful when needed. This school is not a regular school its a family, teachers influencing all students for the better and  even teachers learning from their own students. Teachers here have fair grading and know their subject!', 'It was a \'better than I expected"" experience attending my four years at AUL Charter HS. I met great people, with great intenstions and experienced more than anticipated. I attended prom, visted multiple college my junior year, went to broadway plays, the Federal Reserve Bank of NY, Senior sleepover trip, field days, battle of the classes, student government, and so much more. The school is so much more family oriented and invsted in striving to impact urban families. Teachers put in their own money for class trips to visit colleges. Teachers met with students outside class to assist emotional needs. I felt more like a person and less then a number. I would definetly both recommend and reattend The Academy for Urban Leadership Charter High School.', 'The best thing about being an Alumni from the Academy for Urban Leadership Charter HS was that my fellow classmates and I were the first ever graduating class! The school started with 100 freshman, than invited another 100 freshman the next year and continued untill we had all 4 grades with one 100 students per class. Teachers were honestly really great. It was a start up school which worked out incredibly well! We were a bit babied due to being the very originals, so favoritism was noticable, however; my teachers never made that an excuse to due poorly. Teachers were their for students inside and outside of school. Grading was harder than usual since it was ranked on a college grading level.', 'There are not many after school activities available for students.', ""My favorite experience in this school has been the fashion show because a lot of people go and support and everyone has a good time.  This school is very unique the fact that is small makes it great but the fact that we have to constantly go to other buildings to use other facilities and it gets annoying.  Also the fact that we don't have a wide variety of clubs and organization it's not enjoyable.

Though teachers come and go, one thing this school has taught me that has stuck to me, is to never give up and strive for greatness regardless of your circumstances. My particular academy gave me a sense of character and community. They gave us to the opportunity to speak our mind and we also had the opportunity to be a part of something bigger. We job shadowed early childhood teachers at a local preschool and bonded with kids who helped us build character and a sense of empowerment. Not only was did I excel academically and play a partial role in community service, it taught me a lot about who I need to be and where I need to be and I couldn't more grateful."", ""What I liked about my high school was that I was able to gain knowledge and experience in education early on. I was able to learn about the different careers and certifications available to those pursuing this field. I was also able to get hands on experience in early childhood junior and senior year by going to a head start program and observing during my child development class. This was all great but the overall school needed more influencing and goals. Students need to be motivated. If I could speak about one change that was needed that would be the curriculum. Teachers and administrators need to enforce it rather than to let it slide and assume students in that school just don't care."", 'My Experience here as taught to have a lot of patience\'s with people, and that it is okay if you do not get it right the first time but to go harder your second time.

What i would like to see change is the options that school offer, These kids are very intelligent but they do not have many people to show that too, When i first began here, i wanted to give up on all my dreams because my guidance leader told me i should  change my career choice..

It has plenty of varying clubs and activities, some of which do volunteer work for the community.', 'Perth amboy high school is not one of the best schools to attend, neither am I implying that it is not a good school. It really depends on the staff you end up with and the students interest and effort in completing their four years with a job well done. Academics can be questionable but the extracurricular activities they provide are up to par. There will always be something or everyone to enjoy.', 'I loved being involve in the Performing Arts and Soccer. I had teachers who cared about my success. I was able to receive assistance with college application fees. I felt like I was challenged and was pushed to be the best I could be.', 'The faculty and staff are very friendly. The teachers make learning a great experience. However, they should give the students more options by providing other classes such as criminal justice.', 'I liked how the teachers tried to help you as much as they can, they always came ready to teach.
