Achievement First - Bushwick School,"['It gave me hope in the face of darkness. The school provided me with resources and help the gave me the hope and faith to keep trying when no one else did the teacher and staff were so supportive and they even made sure that I understood the material they took off their day in the afternoon to make sure that I was able to gain the material for next day test or quiz although the homework was a bit stressful it helped me in the long run to be a better student but most of all to help me become a better person', 'If you are looking for a good high school do not choose this one. All this school focuses on is academics and having a good reputation. Other than that it does not allow you to find yourself and your talent. This school is not recognized and does not have a lot of good extracurricular activities.', ""Achievement First Bushwick School did a fantastic job in making sure students were academically prepared for college. However, I feel like they didn't prepare students as well financially and socially given that there were many things to pay for and they stressed the behavioral system more than anything else."", ""Achievement first is a very strict charter school that is all about academics for minority students. In this school everything we do revolves around academics in order to decrease this achievement gap between students of color and white students we work extremely hard and take the most rigorous classes provided to fully prepare us for the works of making it to and through college in 4 years. Besides the academics this school is small although we don't go on trips as often, we are a tight community we all support and uplift all the grade levels of the school. Overall, the experience at the school was tough but it was worth it and i know it will only benefit me at the end."", 'Through out my high school years, it has been hard for me. But, from being a 9th grader not paying a lot of attention to school and not taking it seriously. Growing up to being a 12th grader, i have changed incredibly alot. I have been passing all my classes with high grades. My GPA has been increasing a lot, in the first quarter i had a 3.28 and my second quarter i finished with a 3.66 which makes me an honor roll student. For these coming quarters, i would want to maintain and get a 4.0. This high school have shown me a lot as i grew older. I matured a lot and have shown me right and wrong actions to take. On top of that, its a challenging charter school, the work is more harder than other schools and i have found my way to deal and not procrastinate as much and teachers are always there to support you. Having a great relationship with your teachers is also important. My high school name is Achievement First University Prep High School.', 'Overall, my school has done a lot to ensure that the students in the school are doing their best academically, and are prepared in their plight to graduate college. We have very dedicated teachers and college councelors, who all have the same goal: ensure that their students are all execpted to college, and are fully aware of the things that being in college entails. Although they do well in their education portion of being in the school, the disciplinary system in which the school abides by seems to want to force students into an almost robotic nature. The school does a great job at educating its students, not with understanding them.', 'Alot of he same people that are going to graduate highschool with me soon are alot of the same people I have been with  since I was in elementary school. My school has shown be what it feels like to be a real family. All of my teammates  have eachothers back and teachers emphasize that we are one team and family. The only thing I would change about my school is that it is very strict and sometimes it feels like the students do not have the freedom to express themselves.', 'I really appreciate the effort the teachers and counselor put into supporting the students whether academically, socially, or psychologically. I also enjoy being a part of a very supportive community, where students are celebrating each other for academic achievements and pushing each other to be their best selves. The pre college programs offered to sign up for in the summer is my favorite part about my highschool because I have been able to experience the college life at Columbia, Cornell, and Brown University. These experiences have molded my inquiry and passion that I plan to encounter during my college experience. While the food is not the best, the most important things that matter like support, guidance, opportunities, and quality of learning are provided by my highschool which is why I enjoy being a highschool student of Achievement First University Prep High School.', 'I have been in the charter school system for a while now, and I am glad to say that this school has helped me establish my path to college. The programs offered and the help teachers and counselors provide are amazing. However their strict rules and disciplinary codes have made high school more stressful.', 'I likethat it was a privent school. Theyseriousr about pushing thier students to all be on top. They treat students who are in middle school like high school students when it comesto academice. Each week studeent would be given GPA as to see where they stand if there were to be in High School.', 'I love how Achievement First academically challenges students. Rather than having teachers just come to school to learn, each and every teacher shows an engagement in helping every student learn. Students can genuinely tell that teachers love the job that they do; this sense is hard to find at other schools, but at Achievememt First, this presence always exists. Additionally, there is a dedication to college readiness. Students have a class set aside for college readiness to learn about financial aid, prepare their lists for schools they want to apply to and even work on their personal statement before senior year.

Teachers and all staffs take policies and regulations very seriously.', 'Great diversity and lots of opportunities to get involved with the school. The teachers are also super helpful and there are lots of ap classes you can take. However the students have little to no say in what classes they are given.', 'School of diversity, but lack of spirit. Is in demand of better funding and encouragement for academic prowess amongst students, rather than advocating for early graduation.', 'I had a. Good experience overall at this school. Even though there have been some mismanagement’s by the administration, it didn’t take away my experience with teachers and learning. I was able to communicate and make many friends at this school.', ""Bayside High School to me is just an average high school from it's system of education goes to students, Its like a factory on a daily basis, teachers give a new lesson while students take notes towards classwork, quizzes, and quarterly exams. If one were to not understand the lesson goes such as myself, tutoring was must for me  but the periods for tutoring from my teacher were at my lunch period. The hallways are always crowded for every period that I sometimes get late to a few classes. The bathrooms are sometimes a place I wish I didn't need to go for only being 2 in the school that are dirty or has teens smoking. I tried to do volleyball but wasn't selected due to my lack of skill or probably because the coach didn't have the time to teach rules. Clubs were boring to me because I didn't see any point going to them but when I became a senior having career financial management class, that teacher told me to join clubs as it would be good for colleges to see which I regret a lot."", 'I love how there is so much to do at Bayside! So many clubs and sports for people with all different interests. The clubs actually participate in several events, walks, donations, and more outside of school(not just in school).', 'My teachers were/ are all helpful, they offer tutorial sessions to students who needs it and to students who come for help. my Guidance Councilor is always there to help and support me. I have an IEP and I think that  my school helped me and  supported me . My teachers have always been reaching out to update my parents and it was always convenient for my parent  to attend my IEP meetings, and providing me with informations we need in order to comply and complete the requirements to graduate and pass my regents. My Math and ELA teachers always cared about my grades and they tried to push me to get through it. My speech services were always  available. I joined varsity in my Junior year, I had  a very good experience. Overall, the High school is very good if not, even excellent to other students.', 'This is a very good school! Many of the teachers are very supportive. But if you are lazy and like joking around when it comes to work, this is definitely not the school for you. The teachers will be unable to help you unless you try to make an effort and show them that you want to pass and do what you’ve gotta do to graduate. School lunch is nasty, though. But the breakfast is delicious!', ""It's an okay school to go to. If you want to graduate early, then this school is perfect for you, but if you're hoping to have a good school experience, then don't go here."", ""The foods are horrible.PS.Do not judge my account and DON'T go to this school. The end.I repeat：Do not GO"", ""Bayside is a place that you like because you don't like it, if that makes sense. There are a fair share of teachers I thought were pretty bad, but that saying about friendships forged in fire being stronger is true about my classmates in those particular classes. I've found a lot of supportive people who are now my closest friends because we both wanted to vent about a teacher we didn't consider good.However, all in all, it's a really good school. I haven't heard about any other school giving AP classes in freshman year, and though the workload might get overwhelming, it really prepares you to take a multitude of AP classes in your following years which is really beneficial for college. Also, the school helps you get paid internships, and has really fun events such as the carnival and the muticultural festival."", ""I am currently a junior at Bayside high. School is really good and diversed. There are any of students at the school with different thoughts and different cultures so you always find people doing something amazing whether it's in class or in clubs. Teachers are nice and the academic level is good, you can really challenge yourself and take advance classes. Over all the school is really good and I appreciate everything about it."", 'I like some of the teachers as they care about the students achieving amazing scores. I want Bayside High School to discipline their students more since there are a lot of fights in the hallways. I would also like Bayside High School to get rid of the teachers who do not teach the students well.', ""Being part of the school's enriched student life was a way to really make the most of life in itself. With so many events and the amazing leadership class making each moment of school worth it made everything fun and experience-filled. I would like to see the administration put more focus on our art classes and the art students with giving them more opportunities to show off their art works just like the way the years previous of us has in the main hallway on the first floor. I'd like to see more interacting events that can make everyone in school more involved and happy to go through the school experience. And more of a choice for students to pick and choose their classes, and bring more attention to the students that may feel uncomfortable at classes that they may not necessarily like because of personal issues."", 'Bayside was a great High School. The students and faculty were very diverse. There was great sports teams and extra curricular activities. The neighborhood is safe and public transportation is pretty reliable from most areas in queens.', 'I liked Bayside High School because it was a good school overall. They gave me the opportunity to graduate early so now I am one academic year ahead in college. One thing that could improve though is the staff members, specifically the guidance counselors.', 'I thought Bayside High school over all pushes you to do your best.  All though they have a few bad teachers which I had to endure, they really push you do enroll in A.P courses and make take extra classes and take extra regents.  Some times there safety enforcement restricts students freedom, but there measures prove effective as in and around the school is very clean and safe.', ""Its pretty good and I think that if you hang out with the right people you will do well. If you don't then that is your loss."", 'Bayside High School is proof that too many students hinder the potential of a school.

Yes, a teacher is dating another staff member in the school but no teacher or coach is dating a student. Whether that statement was misconstrued or whatever, that is not what happens here. Squan is a pretty good school. You have a mix of everyone. As an honors and AP student, you get a lot of work but I feel as though you are prepared. But some honors classes are more of a joke and busy work is often given out. The same can be said for certain APs. Some teachers dont care and give busy work, it happens. High school is what you make of it, so if you go here, ignore the rumors you hear or whatever, and come in open minded. Some kids do drugs, a lot of kids drink - but you don't have to do any of that stuff. Not much pressure.

The facilities are a bit cramped, but they work hard to make do with what they have. They offer a reasonable variety of AP classes and a thoughtful history curriculum.', 'This school is pretty good. It has a very diverse environment, making everyone feel comfortable. The teachers are average, with there being some excellent ones and some uninterested ones.', ""There is very little to like about this school. Sure it's diverse, but so is the way people treat each other. Some nice but mostly rude. The cramp building is also a problem and we share a school we can't interact with. Teachers there, while there are some good one's, but sone can't teach well. If you have a problem and go to the authorities, they make you wait and take forever to solve the problem. The food is gross too and the school has no money for terrible gym equipment. If you are graduating middle school and plan to go to this high school, just don't."", 'AAS is a school where you will not be disappointed. From start to finish, there are teachers that care and will help you along the way. While cramped due to the overcrowding, a new building is coming within the next 3-4 years.', 'Academy of American Studies is a great school! You will really feel at home there. Teachers will help with any work and the classes are fantastic!', 'Pros: diversity, strong history and English departments, manageable workload, a lot of extracurriculars, a decent amount of AP courses, a good amount of decent to amazing teachers (Greenspan,  Deng, Koo), does decent in college preparation (senior thesis, 80 minute classes)Cons: 7 a.m. classes, overcrowdedness, weak math & science departments, principal spends a lot of money on opera trips, hazardous gym classes (150 students)', 'A school made up of mostly determined and academically successful students. Extremely diverse. Some disrespectful and drama-creating students. Most teachers are alright, could be better. Work load is sometimes high.', 'Academy of American studies is a very small poor school. We share buildings with newcomers high school, but most likely in 2021 they are going to have a new building for academy students. Our recent principal spends most of the money that the school gets on opera trips to Lincoln center instead of the school sports teams or supplies. The teachers at academy are decent, there are really nice and great teachers like Mr. Deng, Ms. Greenspan, Ms. Black, Ms. Duran and many more but then there are the really mean with bad attitude teachers and staff. The gym classrooms are over packed and the size of the gym barely fits the amount of kids in the class because this year 2016-2017 our principal accepted more freshmen than the school can fit.', 'My experience in this school was good because I learned to improve in my studies and interpersonal skills. This school helps students focus on their college goals, such as what college they want to go to and how they can reach their goal to get their. I have prepared for college in a excelled way at this school from having classes that are one hour and 10min to college workshops in classroom. I have gained a variety amount of knowledge in my education and experience in this school. This school guides you to do better in the future, especially in college.', 'I like how, it being a small school, everyone knows each other and you get the chance to really get to know the teachers.', 'The Academy of American Studies is a vastly underrated school that deserves more credit. This is a great school for students to become prepared for college, from offering a wide range of AP courses, SAT prep classes, as well as college courses. The school demonstrates a sense of diversity from all different types of backgrounds, despite this, you will never feel a sense of being left out because everyone gets along well with one another. Another pro would be the clubs and activities, most students that attend this school are always involved in extracurricular activities because the school offers a vast majority. The teachers are also great educators because they are always willing to go out of their way to help students who need the extra help. Overall, this school presents an interactive and friendly environment for everyone that attends.', ""I've been in Academy of American Studies for 4 years and I'm expected to graduate June 2017. My experience in this school has been okay, I like the diversity in this school which made me meet new people. Also there are some teachers who are willing to support you all the way. However, my school accepts too many kids and at the end doesn't have too much space for all of us. In our gym period, we have 220 kids and can't have our own proper lockers. Then, our classes are too long, I understand to prepare us for college but it's very stressing for us."", ""More or less teachers are truly knowledgeable in the subject they teach. Most of these subjects are useful. In my case, environmental science is just another class where one can sleep to the teacher's monotonous voice and yet, get a passing grade."", ""In my four years at this high school, I haven't learned of any bullying news whatsoever. The students are engaged in their studies and get along with each other so there's not much safety issues. The buildings are very clean and the nurse is available at all times in case of emergencies."", 'There are different clubs formed by students and most of them tend to be fun and allows students to know each other better.

Most teachers are fun and engaging, the cafeteria food defies all stereotypes as it is ranges from health to yummy. Has a salad bar and pizza section open everyday along with bagels in the fridge and chips and ice cream to the side as well as an ever changing food of the day. Sports are both engaging and tiresome as coaches have access to an in school gym equipped with everything from treadmills to weights. Academically this school offers everything including classes in forensics, computer programming classes, astronomy, fashion classes, AP and honors in all aspects, ect. However the school is not very racially diverse, and most families are living more than well off, meaning most kids who attend this school dont have a realistic view on the world and its financial aspects.', 'My experience at Mahopac High School has been wonderful. I have had some really exceptional teachers and some that could be better. I have connected with the students.

The teachers are such great human beings who understand what it's like being a high schooler. I feel like as a high schooler, we've all felt that adults don't understand the stress we're under, but the teachers here do. Also, the guidance couselours are the most caring mentors you'll meet here. They remember all their students and help give guidance through the small things life a fight with a friend to big things like applying to colleges.

Longwood promotes both the STEM field through its internship opportunities and the Arts through its music programs, art honor societies, and multi-media classes. Longwood offers a multitude of different clubs from fitness clubs, to improvisational music jam sessions, to book clubs and cartooning lessons. While Longwood offers these opportunities, some of them, especially travel related activities, are unavailable to students from low income families. Opportunities such as Longwood Travels, Princeton Model Congress, and the annual Comicon trip are unattainable for some students. Even the yearbook and the prom are beyond what some families can pay. There is a clearly cut socioeconomic division that I wish the school could bridge together.

Over the past four years I've had my ups and downs with teachers and peers but the school has a good way of helping students when in need. Most teachers here are good at teaching to each students way of learning and are very helpful when needed. However like all places not everything is all sunshine and rainbows. I've had my fair share of bad teachers who truly can't teach, control a class, or are just flat out rude. Also in the beginning of my freshman year I struggled with friends and was in a very bad mental state but with the help of guidance counselors and the growing bond between my teammates on cross country and track I was able to get out of my bad head space."", 'Longwood High School was a great experience and as a recent alum, I do miss it.

The diverse population along with the huge number of clubs and activities will ensure that you find a place where you belong and enjoy yourself. Although there may be a lot of different things going on at once, you can count on the entire school bonding together at football games and other events. Most school days consist of simple quarrels or even physically violent fights. The students can sometimes get disrespectful towards the staff and roam the halls even when class is in session. There have been many instances where the police had to be brought in for investigation. Although the AP students remain at the top in the entire vicinity of Long Island, the students that remain at the bottom of the class (grade-wise) are reluctant to attain education and better themselves.

The teachers are qualified, for the most part, and you are usually well-prepared for Regents, APs, etc as long as you pay attention and do work.

Something I like the most is the variety of elective classes that we can take, which is helpful for discovering what we want to do in college.The school is so large because the district it serves is unusually big.  Because of the district size, there are thousands of students. The hallways get crowded during switching periods, resulting in traffic jams in hallway intersections. If you are going to a class on the other side of the school, you will  be late almost daily due to the traffic and distance.

Additionally, there have been multiple instances where fights have broken out between students.

The teachers and academics were outstanding. I never felt uncomfortable approaching my teachers, walking around the school, or being a part of a club or sport team. The coaches too were amazing and made my experience at the high school far more better than I would ever imagine. I also love the activities that the school provides the students with to get involved. There’s always an opportunity to get involved. The security could be better, as I do not feel one hundred percent safe, but they are starting to improve that by enforcing the students to wear ID badges and the constant monitoring of who exits and enters the building. Overall, I rate my school with 5 stars! I loved my experience and cannot wait to see what the future holds!', ""The past 4 years at West Islip Senior High School prepared me for all of my post secondary school plans.

Academics should be the focal point of all schools."", ""Although there were some good things about this school and I made many lifelong friends, I cant give it more than 2/5 because there is so much wrong with this school. Most of the teachers are nice enough and a few are excellent, but many others either shove homework down the students' throats or don't care and let them run amok. So many of the classes are boring and made frustrating to good teachers and students that do care by others who goof of. Many times these students slow down academic progress and force teachers to take liberties within the course. This has really slowed the school down over the past few years as those the music and arts programs have taken a nose-dive from a formerly superior status. There are so many cruel students who pick on students with special needs that any person with a conscious would have the common sense to feel disgusted.

There were competent teachers and staff, and the career-based classes were educational, but definitely not as much as they should have been. The classes were usually interactive and engaging. The teachers were sometimes inadequate in controlling their loquacious and rowdy students, but that could be seen as the fault of the latter. The facilities were generally clean. College readiness is something that is poorly inculcated in students, by the beginning of senior year, as students are practically given deadlines for things they have no idea what are. But they learn what they need to in time. In reality, the image I had of high school when I started was not what I received. I was given something better, and it was worth every second. I wish it didn't pass by so quickly."", 'Thomas Edison High School is not really your typical high school.

I was pretty much an introvert and not somebody who made friends easily. Most of the people are nice if you try to stay with a good crowd, usually students with higher grades. Joining a sport was difficult because some of the coaches, PE teachers were a little discouraging or had favoritism to whom they want on the team. This school needs to be open-minded with students in shop classes because many students got put into shop classes they didn't like after a sophomore year and were stuck there till graduation. This school needs more AP classes because I wanted to try chemistry or physics at the college level to be better prepared.

All the other programs were either academic related where you had to be selected in order to even join, or just the standard, student council or robotics.

Food was mediocre and there was no diversity, but you cannot blame the school for the diversity problem as it is a very white town.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""My experience for the last 4 years has been very good.  The teachers are experienced, compassionate, and some are even entertaining.  However, being a Senior I must share this school year's experience.  We have turned over to Block Scheduling.  The academic aspect has been fine, however, socially and safety has not.  The entire school, all four grades, have the same exact lunch time.  Since the cafeteria can not seat everyone, some have to eat in the gym, and other areas of the school.  I used to look forward to purchasing lunch, but now I bring due to the long lines and limited choices."", 'Overall, I loved Manalapan High School.  I had an amazing experience over the past four years, from academics to after school clubs, I enjoyed every second of high school at Manalapan High School.  The teachers always did a great job teaching me while also making learning fun and enjoyable.  I love that there is so much school spirit at Manalapan High School and that everyone who goes there is truly proud to be a Brave.  Every year of high school, there were new and different improvements in technology used for learning such as different computer labs and learning spaces.  If there were one thing I would change about Manlapan High School, it would be to get rid of block scheduling.  Block scheduling has been a recent addition to the school and I believe it makes lunch and the hallways chaotic, students have a hard time keeping track of due dates and class periods are too long for some students to focus during but overall I love Manalapan High School.', 'I love the school spirit. We are truly a huge family. Also, I like how helpful and influential some teachers have been. However, I would like better lunches and easier access to guidance offices and appointments.', ""I've enjoyed my experience as a Manalapan High School Student. I've created positive relationships with several of my teachers which allowed me to succeed academically in my classes. The guidance counselors are very helpful as well in assisting in academic pursuits such as helping chose classes for an upcoming school year or helping to apply for college. However, one thing that could be beneficial to Manalapan High School is to make a change in the lunch situation. As of right now, the entire school has one lunch period which tends to get a bit chaotic and I believe splitting it into two or more lunch periods would benefit the school as a whole."", 'Manalapan High School is your run of the mill public high school with hallways too small to fit the students.', 'Manalapan High School is a school with around 2,000 students that offer activities that allow those students to cross paths. Block scheduling has been adopted recently for our district and is causing chaos every so often, causing students to not be able to buy lunch in a timely period as well as not being able to eat at a table. Otherwise, the staff is overall good at their jobs and teach students to the best of their ability. Diversity among the school is poor due to the area which causes some school lifestyles to cater toward the majority. There are students who are rude and feel they are above people, and students who are simply kids going to school. Not many fights break out here, for that is not the culture of this school. Overall, the school is like an average school being corrupted by block scheduling.', 'The teachers care about the education of their students and will try their best to make sure they succeed. They also have great food options.', 'Great school district to grow up in. Students and parents are friendly. Built lifelong friendships throughout my journey at manalapan high school.

I was able to excel and take AP and honors level courses that helped me to challenge myself fully.  My teachers pushed me to understand the topics covered and when I didn't fully understand them they offered extra help and made themselves available for me.  They help schedule your classes so you can take the ones you need academically and also give the option for fitting in some of the fun ones (like our food education classes!).  Our administration wants you to succeed and try and make the four years here the best possible.  I'm especially happy with how my senior year is going.  As I'm wrapping up with topics, I'm excited for the extra rewards seniors get, like senior week.  Manalapan High School is an enjoyable place with great teachers, and I've learned a lot through my years here."", 'Manalapan is a fairly good high school. All teachers are good at their job and make an effort to engage students in the lessons. After going here I feel more prepared for college!', ""Manalapan is a OK school with nice teachers( well most of them ). The only problem i had with this school was that some of the teachers were way too controlling. Some of them wanted us to do exactly what at all times, usually this isn't a problem but they take it way out of control! Ive seen teacher fail a whole class because they didn't agree with way she was teaching, and even though the student took their concerns to administration nothing was done about her! If your going to this school don't be afraid to talk to your consoler about honorable teachers, they be able to get you out of the class 9 times out of 10."", 'Manalapan is a great school for academics, is very diverse, and has an overall good culture. It has a great football team and a good student support system.', 'Manalapan High School was a high school that focused mainly on the football players and their needs. There was not even a track for the track runners, and the school would spend money on supplies for the football  field and the players. There were constant drug deals and smokers in the bathrooms and the teachers were oblivious to it all. There were a lot of cliques, and not a lot of social interaction from cliques to other cliques. This school has even gotten worse after I graduated.', 'I liked everything about high school! It was a great 4 years, the only thing I would change would be the drama club director.', 'I loved all my teachers, my friends had some pretty terrible ones though. Overall will miss it dearly moving onto college.', ""Manalapan is a great high school if you are looking for a good combination of academics and athletics. There is a widespread difference in teacher's teaching abilities, so it is important to get background info before you pick your classes/teachers."", 'Manalapan high school is a good school.

A lot of them are young and they all relate and connect with the students well. Obviously every teacher is different though and your going to have some not great teachers. The school offers plenty of AP and honors classes which will help for college. The lunch is not all that great but it's survivable. School diversity is lacking, mostly wealthy white students.

I attended all Manalapan schools from K-8 and I've spent all 4 years in Manalapan Highschool. I couldn't of asked for a better experience. From the teachers, to the lunch aids, and to the students I surrounded myself with every day couldn't of been better. The atmosphere the school had was always positive and people were always there motivating to each and every student.

I would go back and redo my whole high school experience over again if I could."", ""My time at Manalapan High School has been great. Most of the teachers that I have had taught well and were very educational. I felt prepared for tests and quizzes that came my way. Activities and clubs are popular. I am currently captain of the step team and am part of a few other clubs. If you ever needed to talk to a teacher or someone from administration, they'd be there to listen. Scheduling was relatively good."", ""Manalapan High School was not a very good school. Not only was the education poor, but the students themselves were raised to be stuck up. In my 4 years at Manalapan High School, one teacher was arrested for selling drugs to a student, the principal was fired for soliciting money from the school's funds, and 2 more principals stepped up and left. Overall, not satisfied. "", 'I like the fact that after four years at Manalapan High School, you get to know most of the students and teachers. Almost everyone is nice and there is a big range of ideas open for discussion.', 'At my school, I\'ve taken a variety level of classes (Intermediate, Honors, AP), participated in many clubs (Students Against Drunk Driving, United Cultural Awareness, Cancer Awareness, Concert and Marching Band, and Special Strides). Being involved in all these activities have introduced me to many teachers, and teaching styles. At my school the teachers are all very friendly and happy and always want the best for their students. All teachers are open and it is very easy to develop ad friendship with your teacher outside the classroom. They always have open ears and open doors, they\'re interested in the success and happiness students wish to have. I\'ve seen teachers help get students prom dates, deal with breakups, divorces, ""highschool drama"", and anything any highschool could be going through. In the classroom, teachers always find a unique way to summarize what was learned, and cater to all learning styles.', 'There has been few lockdowns and there were polices involved too', 'There was a lot of extracurricular activities in school but i was not really involved in them', ""Some of the students thought they were better than everyone else. i don't know if ill want to go back"", 'Teachers in Manalapan High School were very helpful', 'As long as you know what to expect ahead of time in a class, it can work well in your favor.

Sports and Drama club/tech/stage crew are very popular. But, the sets for the play are made cheap because of a lack of supplies and they don't look sturdy at all. Once you find what clubs you are truly happy in, it is very easy to feel like part of the club and make friends."", ""It really depends on what teacher you have. Some are very laid-back, fun, and will treat their students with kindness. However, there are a few teachers that aren't good at their jobs. But, the relationship between good teachers and students is what I believe makes our school unique."", 'Safety is good for the most part. There are security cameras, security guards, and police frequently enter the school. However, I think it;s a bit excessive to have teachers watch the bathrooms. I always felt safe in school.', 'Extracurricular activities are okay.  There is a lot of variety in the activities, but none of the clubs other than athletic clubs are very advanced. Many clubs other than sports clubs get pushed aside. I have been in clubs such as the National Art Honor Society and Environmental club, but some people do not even know that these clubs exist because they get no acknowledgement which is very frustrating. I think Manalapan has to pay more attention to non-athletes.', 'If I had a choice of what high school to attend all over again, I would choose Manalapan High School.  I think that Manalapan High School offers a very good education for students.  Most students that I have known over my years have all been very intelligent.  There are many after school clubs, however I do think that the funding needs to be better.  Specifically, I think class council needs to work a little harder to fundraise. There are many clubs, but none other than the sports ones are cared about which is disappointing. I have loved the friends I have made at this school, and loved feeling like I was getting a very good education for 4 years. Overall, Manalapan High School is a very good school.', 'It is very difficult to generalize all of the teachers in one category because I have had both terrible and disrespectful teachers as well as extraordinary teachers. Overall some teachers try to teach in many different ways too help different types of learners while others stick to one style.  II have had teachers who just do a pure lecture while others use games and hands on examples to get the point across. Most of my teachers have had good communication skills and are for the most part able to help students after school.  Grading consistency is generally very good. In the beginning of the year teachers set a grading policy and stick by it. Most of my teachers have shown a great deal of knowledge in the subject they are teaching, specifically my history teachers have impressed me with their knowledge.', 'People tend to drop out of clubs after a while.

One thing I think they need to improve on is the college readiness. I do think I was prepared for college because I did my own research but I think they need to do a better job helping the kids that do not do that.', ""Sachem is probably the most unorganized and bias school district on long island. In three out of my four years in high school, three of my own teachers were arrested for things such as rape, embezzlement, and drugs. There was some good teachers at North, but As an AP student learning is very important to me and some teachers really helped me grow, while others were unsatisfactory and left me in constant stress and anxiety over tests and school. That being said, I will say the students at North were for the most part kind.Every school has its bullies but Sachem North, I believe had more stupid and ignorant people, who looked to fit in, I cant say there were too many bullies.  Cafeteria food was okay, but the room itself was always messy, with the occasional food fights. For athletes I'm sure Sachem is perfect but for the others like me, the lack of fun, interesting clubs was underwhelming, and disappointing."", 'My time at Sachem North was never unpleasant, it is a good school with good teachers who are caring and help in any way possible to make sure you succeed.', 'Sachem High School provided me with great opportunity.   Although we had a very large high school I never felt like it was too big.  The teachers were excellent as well as the sports program.', 'I love my school but teachers are a hit or miss. Some of the teachers are absolutely amazing and the other ones are absolutely awful. The school itself is a tiny bit dirty and the bathrooms the same but it’s a larger school so that’s understandable. I think the school could benefit from new paint, a lot of the old paint makes the school seem dreary and dark and the colors are very strange choices of colors. I’ve never had any bad experiences in my school and the staff has always been nice and helpful to me. I’ve had the most amazing experience with my guidance counselor, she is very helpful, understanding, and caring.', 'I really enjoyed Sachem North. I took AP classes which helped me get ahead in college. I was a part of Sachem North Varsity Arrowettes, the dance team, and made so many friends, and went to nationals in Orlando. Sachem North always remembered serving others. For example,National Honor Society had opportunities weekly to participate in tutoring, Mircale League Network baseball, and Ruffhouse Rescue. Not to mention the senior tradition of the Dirty Dozen Food Drive near Thanksgiving , and the toy drive near the holidays. I loved Sachem North, the students, teachers, and classes.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Lack of student support system even at time of life and death situations.As esl student, I  don’t get extra time on  test.  My first year there was no support  and they expect me to take esl test.  The school and teachers in no way prepared  me. On the esl tests always suprises, when I take it I don’t feel prepared for it.  The school focuses more in the other subject areas than for esl students providing prep classes. Further, democracy prep long days can be tiring and boring.

This was where the part we're things were falling apart because my Math teacher was horrible. She was mostly talking about some random junk that was irrelevant to Geometry throughout the semester and she barely gave student homework which might be a good thing but I couldn't throughly understand geometry and I had to take the geometry regents. If I failed the geometry regents, I had to retake it so I tried my best to not fail.

I love the atmosphere and great environment in the school that mad me fee like I'm home. The academic opportunities are numerous as the school has multiple AP classes, plenty of honors classes, and college classes to make sure we are prepared for college. Being one of the biggest school in NYC with over 4,000 students and staff, the school makes sure safety is number one as we conduct safety drills routinely. As well, deans and administrators always make sure to keep us safe and make sure things are orderly but conducting the hallways. The schools variety sports are also one of the most competitive in the city, as we have a great football team where students bond to cheer on the boys.  Tottenville has given me great memories with amazing friends I have met along my journey."", 'My four years in Tottenville High School were filled with great memories and relationships whether it be with my teachers, sport, clubs, or friends! This school gives great opportunity for you to chase your dream through many 3 years programs, clubs, sports, and education. Although, Tottenville is a great school, some things that could be improved upon are how certain athletes are treated and how some teachers teach their students.', 'Teachers are understanding and tries their best to help students with school work. The school is big and has about 4,000 students. There are many clubs and sports available. There are many classes and chances to take challenging courses throughout your 4 years. These classes includes honors, AP, and College Now classes.', 'Tottenville High School is a very welcoming school. The principal, teachers and everyone are so welcoming.

SING! was the highlight of my highschool experience', 'Tottenville High School is an average high school. Some teachers are excellent and others just do a really poor job at teaching. This school can be fun sometimes. What I like about it is that it offers few AP classes(at least) and has a lot of clubs and sports teams. This hs can improve by providing MORE AP classes and making them available and known to all students.', 'I have made so many memories here at this school. I am involved in so many extra curricular activities that this school has to offer from SING, the hip hop club, the Spring musicals, and the community service events offered through the school. I have made so many friends and created special bonds with some of the teachers here that I have had over the past 4 years where I know they expect me to always try my best in order for me to succeed. I love Tottenville!', 'What I like about Tottenville High School is the after school programs being so diverse and available for everyone.  I also like the sports program at Tottenville.

North Brunswick Township High School,"['Overall, the amount of stress and work the teachers force onto the students is stressful and insane. I went from going to an A average student in middle school, to at the least a C average student in high school. If there was not as much pressure and work as there was on the students, going to school would be so much easier and I would most likely actually enjoy going to school.', 'Some things that I enjoyed about going to North Brunswick Township High School was the diversity in students, you could find all types of people there. It isn’t that difficult to make new friends, a lot of people there are outgoing and tend to have mindfulness of others. Some teachers do care very much about students and want them to succeed and give their effort in helping them do that. School spirit is very in effect, sports and music are all taken very seriously. You’ll see the stadium packed for a football game and see an auditorium full for a band concert or play. You get to express yourself freely and although some things could be better in terms of organization and keeping on course, this school isn’t bad. I’d rate it over many other schools and the culture is definitely unique.', 'North Brunswick high school offer a really good education, it is a really good district with good teacher and good consulars. Teachers care about student, if a student is struggling in any subject the teacher will provide care and will help the student in order for the student to be successful. North Brunswick high school is an school with students of different cultures, bullying is rare because teachers make sure to provide a good environment in their classes.

We have exceptional teachers,classes and a wide variety of afterschool clubs that are offered.', 'North Brunswick Twp. High School is melting pot of different cultures where every student is accepted into the community. The teachers genuinely care about the students and their futures, as they are teaching the students valuable life lessons along with their lesson plans.', 'I like the teachers at North Brunswick very much as I find that they teach extremely well, especially my history teachers. I find the school to be generally a safe environment but something I would definitely change about my school is overall security and hall monitoring. I would create a hall monitoring system in which trustworthy students and teachers would be able to monitor halls and also attempt to have security thoroughly check who comes into the school.', 'After my almost four full years at North Brunswick Township High School, I really like the friendships that I have made. It has been an interesting experience. Every teacher definitely has your back and will help you with things both in and out of school. I have had my own personal difficulties with my teachers and fellow classmates, but that has never stopped me from achieving academic success. I am happy to say that this school has given me a number of opportunities, particularly with my photography and I am more than grateful to have had these experiences.

Although, for the most part, Roxbury students get along well which makes extracurricular activities really fun.', ""I like that everybody mostly got along and that it was a very comfortable environment. I think it should orient itself to be more of a preparation of life after highschool, which was a feeling I didn't fully get, but my overall experience was good at Roxbury."", ""Overall, Roxbury HS is a good school.  The teaching staff, in general, are dedicated professional who relate well and care about the students.  What anyone coming into this district need to be concerned about is that, when the district is in contract negotiations with the teacher's union, a common tactic of the union is to use the students as political pawns to get what they want.  They instruct the staff to stop helping students after school and not write recommendations for students who are looking towards college.  At such a critical time in a student's life, this should be unacceptable to each and every parent.  The students should not be used as pawns in this power struggle.  The union leadership puts their pocketbook issues before the well-being of the students.  If you are just coming into this district or at lower grade levels, you need to be concerned about this."", 'Roxbury High school is a typical high school with a great art department as well as music department.

I also appreciate that the school is inclusive of all different students. While sports are heavily praised, the music department is equally massive and important. Events such as the school musical and the school concerts are held with great importance because the school values music education. The time I have spent in honors symphony, chamber orchestra club, honors choir, tri-M, and the school musicals have had a major positive impact on my life.

There are several educators at EIHS who I am comfortable with and that I can talk to. Most of the coaches I have had have taught me. I have been on sports teams through all seasons. I am fortunate that EIHS has sports teams and other clubs and activities for students. There are resources but we have to learn to take advantage of them. High school can be difficult at times. It can be hard to be yourself and feel like you fit in.  Educators would probably prefer you be unique and stand out. In sports you want to stand out.

Those who did well academically and athletically DID get into great colleges!', 'I enjoyed going to school. Seeing my friends and all the teachers I grew close to everyday helped encourage me to want to go to school and do better.', 'I personally feel that East Islip High School is a great school because it provided me with a lot of options. The AP classes that were available to me as well as many other extracurricular classes allowed me to decide my strengths and weaknesses, as well as what subjects I do and do not enjoy. I also appreciate that the school is inclusive of all different students. While sports are heavily praised, the music department is equally massive and important. Events such as the school musical and the school concerts are held with great importance because the school values music education. The time I have spent in honors symphony, chamber orchestra club, honors choir, tri-M, and the school musicals have had a major positive impact on my life. This experience would not have been possible at many other schools. I also got the chance to be part of the varsity cross country and track teams for some time. I gained a great deal of knowledge about discipline, strength, and  teamwork through this.', ""My experience at East Islip was very good and memorable. I will never forget the loud chants of its students at every football game, or the fun ideas students came up with during our Spirit Week. I only wish that the school's faculty would listen to students' opinions more, and that the school's security was improved- especially when it comes to how easily people can enter and exit the school."", 'My personal Experience at East Islip High School has been great. The teachers have all been very friendly and helpful. The clubs have provided a fun and diverse way to get involved in current activities, and have enriched the school environment. The academics have helped prepared me for college, and have given me lessons and information that will be beneficial to my future. Overall, the experience so far has been very good.', 'Having a great time as a senior with all the elective classes that are offered here. Looking forward to the school plays.', ""My years at East Islip High School have helped me become the hardworking, dedicated, resourceful, and well-rounded person that I am today. I've formed close friendships with teachers that have prepared me for the next chapter of my life. The clubs and activities offered by East Islip High School have taught me responsibility and leadership, and  have allowed me to give back to my community. Students here are filled with EI pride, which they never fail to showcase at school events."", ""The music department is the best on Long Island! I am a professional musician because of my education here. We start learning an instrument in the 3rd grade so by the time you're a senior you can play on Broadway."", 'EIHS is a good school with some really great teachers.Excellent video production and TV broadcasting classes as well as photography classes. Good sports programs including a great football team.  Homecoming festival and a talent show run by the Key club are a lot of fun.', 'I have had an overall good experience at East Islip. I think that my involvement in sports, my whole life, has helped me to work hard, compete and succeed. I have always been lucky that my parents supported and guided me and that my dad has been there and coached me along the way. There are several educators at EIHS who I am comfortable with and that I can talk to. Most of the coaches I have had have taught me. I have been on sports teams through all seasons. I am fortunate that EIHS has sports teams and other clubs and activities for students. There are resources but we have to learn to take advantage of them. High school can be difficult at times. It can be hard to be yourself and feel like you fit in.  Educators would probably prefer you be unique and stand out. In sports you want to stand out. Sports teams have always been there for me and I always felt like I was a part of something. I hope to play baseball in college so I will continue to feel like I am truly part of something.', 'School facilities need improvement. Many great teachers who are dedicated and work very hard. Class offerings are plentiful. The school district in general is not very diverse but very welcoming of diversity.', ""I'm proud to say I attend East Islip High School. We have the most caring teachers who teach us more than modules. I feel like they have prepared me for college and I know they genuinely care about the students. We also have stellar music and art programs. My experience here has been memorable and I will be reluctant to leave at the end of this year."", 'East Islip HS has the best music program on the Island!  Mr. Neske runs the band program, honors music theory class, marching band, and HS musical.  He is the most dedicated teacher and mentor along with the entire music department.', 'East Islip High School is a good school. They try and get the kids involved with the school activities.', ""The teachers are truly the back bone of the school and try to keep things running when everything's falling apart. Little diversity and preparing us for college could've been better."", 'A majority of teachers are truly amazing; however, some have got to go. My time at the high school so far has been a journey and the various clubs that I participate in make the overall school experience better. The one thing that needs to be fixed is students roaming the halls and vaping in the bathrooms without getting caught. Also, even though there are a great number of clubs, there is not enough variation in the activities and clubs that exist. Teachers and administrators constantly try to improve school spirit, but it still needs improvement.', ""Compared to other schools, East Islip High School is full of both passionate and eager teachers and staff that easily become life long friends even after graduation. With a vast multitude of available classes, especially in the art department for myself, you can leave EIHS feeling ready for top-chart prestigious colleges all over the country. Though, like many, EI lacks certain funding in department which can really hurt both it's students and it's staff. But the future looks bright for incoming students, and I wish them all luck in their studies!"", 'I liked how helpful my guidance counselor was with everything regarding college. I think the whole bathroom situation should be taken care of better.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""I have had a pretty good times here.

Overall I would rate Fairchild Wheeler a very good experience.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I have met people who are now by best friends in this place and I have learned a lot in my 4 years that I have been here', 'I attended the school for three years and have just recently graduated in 2017.

With that said, the district and administration do the best that they can to engage the students and encourage involvement in academics, clubs and activities.', 'It’s a great place with a great community. It’s somewhat small with 180-200 students per grade. This forms a great community where everyone knows everyone. The teachers are really nice.  Classes somewhat vary. Some, challenge you to a reasonable level while others are not as challenging. Sports are great and expanding, recently even adding a volleyball club that will become a team.  The clubs offer the students a chance to be more involved in the school, however, it is missing some clubs that most schools have, like a robotics or clubs pertaining to certain career paths. This is one of the safest schools since the police station is the building right in front of the school. Food served is managable.

They all are committed to their jobs and seem to love teaching, but it is so easy to differentiate between the tenured and non tenured teachers. The math department carries that vibe he most, with the main teachers, Mrs. Mikulak and Mr. Marvinny often failing to teach their upper level students adequately. This results in tension in the classroom. Other than them, however, the teachers are mostly very nice and always willing to stay after school, come In the morning or even give up their lunch/ prep period to help you, and they're very approachable even if you are not a student of theirs. Often times, if you've had an older sibling come through SHS, teachers you haven't even had will know you, which is kinda nice. There has been a recent influx of new teachers and I don't know how they are, but they also seem to be knowledgable friendly and willing to help."", ""I feel very safe at school. We started having a police officer join the security team at SHS, but he doesn't make you feel uneasy or unsafe. The nurse, however, is notoriously hard to find.

Many teachers also get very excited about their subject which can't help but get you excited as well. They do their best to involve students in classroom activities through active discussion (if applicable) and new and fun activities like Kahoot. Many teachers also have a great sense of humor which makes the class all the more enjoyable. Our teachers give us chances to speak and in certain classes speak our minds about topics close to our hearts, such as politics, world events, even food. Language teachers give us the opportunity to learn more about culture and history as well as language. History teachers are so passionate that they get up on desks and create scenarios about the topic being taught. Science teachers find fun ways to incorporate what we're learning into labs and allow us to try new things and equipment (with supervision obviously). The teachers here give you all the opportunities to come in for help before and after school. Many of the teachers stay for hours after the school day actually ends. The teachers at Spotswood are dedicated to their jobs and they definitely go above and beyond for the students and their parents."", 'I am lucky enough to live in a primarily ""safe"" and quiet town.

I feel like there are adequate activities and the teachers and admin  are highly involved in all activities."", 'I loved this place! The teachers there were the best, and I miss it very much! I got a great education and got a lot of tools to help me move on to college.', 'Spotswood is an excellent high school that is unable to provide to the best of their ability because of the size of the district. They do not have enough money to provide students with the newest or best academic opportunities because of the lack of money put into the school. With that said, the district and administration do the best that they can to engage the students and encourage involvement in academics, clubs and activities.', 'It’s a great place with a great community. It’s somewhat small with 180-200 students per grade. This forms a great community where everyone knows everyone. The teachers are really nice.  Classes somewhat vary. Some, challenge you to a reasonable level while others are not as challenging. Sports are great and expanding, recently even adding a volleyball club that will become a team.  The clubs offer the students a chance to be more involved in the school, however, it is missing some clubs that most schools have, like a robotics or clubs pertaining to certain career paths. This is one of the safest schools since the police station is the building right in front of the school. Food served is managable. They offer a sandwich station every day where they can heat it up for you. On Wednesdays there is a pasta station. These tend to be good meals but the lines for them are very long. Other than that the food is average.', 'Spotswood High School helped me grow as a student and form lifelong friendships. Although the school may not have the most current text books or the most luxurious equipment, I genuinely learned a lot of essential skills for college and for life in general. This school has many down-to-earth students and teachers who support each other and help one another grow. All in all, Spotswood ultimately helped me become the successful person I am today.', 'Spotswood is a very safe school and everyone is friends. There really isn’t any bullying that happens. The principal is really fun and likes to joke around all the time with you. The community always comes together to help the school out in a way possible.', 'I like the sports and atmosphere of the school. Most of the teachers are great but there are a select few that shouldn’t be teaching. There are many different clubs and activities to participate in so there’s always something to do.', 'Spotswood high school is a very enthusiastic and unique school. I graduated last year and could not have had better teachers', 'I really enjoy the staff, especially the principal. He is very fair and understanding. Not every course i desired to take was offered, which is understandable in a small school district and is made up for with more personal attention and availability of teachers before and after school.', ""The teachers at SHS seem to fit the whole spectrum. They all are committed to their jobs and seem to love teaching, but it is so easy to differentiate between the tenured and non tenured teachers. The math department carries that vibe he most, with the main teachers, Mrs. Mikulak and Mr. Marvinny often failing to teach their upper level students adequately. This results in tension in the classroom. Other than them, however, the teachers are mostly very nice and always willing to stay after school, come In the morning or even give up their lunch/ prep period to help you, and they're very approachable even if you are not a student of theirs. Often times, if you've had an older sibling come through SHS, teachers you haven't even had will know you, which is kinda nice. There has been a recent influx of new teachers and I don't know how they are, but they also seem to be knowledgable friendly and willing to help."", ""I feel very safe at school. We started having a police officer join the security team at SHS, but he doesn't make you feel uneasy or unsafe. The nurse, however, is notoriously hard to find. Sometimes she comes in late and nobody can find her, so that's a bit annoying for people who get sick a lot."", 'Although the school is not as diverse as many others, there really is a club for everybody. There is a safe space for everyone and their interests, which is really impressive at SHS. Teachers really love being advisors to these clubs as they are often an extension of passions they already have. the student-teacher camaraderie made in sports and clubs is really priceless, and more than what you can make in the classroom.', ""The teachers at my school are very knowledgable in the subject they teach. Many teachers also get very excited about their subject which can't help but get you excited as well. They do their best to involve students in classroom activities through active discussion (if applicable) and new and fun activities like Kahoot. Many teachers also have a great sense of humor which makes the class all the more enjoyable. Our teachers give us chances to speak and in certain classes speak our minds about topics close to our hearts, such as politics, world events, even food. Language teachers give us the opportunity to learn more about culture and history as well as language. History teachers are so passionate that they get up on desks and create scenarios about the topic being taught. Science teachers find fun ways to incorporate what we're learning into labs and allow us to try new things and equipment (with supervision obviously). The teachers here give you all the opportunities to come in for help before and after school. Many of the teachers stay for hours after the school day actually ends. The teachers at Spotswood are dedicated to their jobs and they definitely go above and beyond for the students and their parents."", 'I am lucky enough to live in a primarily ""safe"" and quiet town. Because of that, the highschool does not have to deal with and extreme problems or crime which I like.', 'DECA is the most prominent successful club in the school. It is a club that comptes locally, state wide, and nationally in theareas of finance, amrketing, and business. Spotswood is known for our great turnout of finalists.

This caused much disruption in school for students because many people felt uncomfortable and restrained.

The students at Foran are really into school pride and football games are just one of the few things I will miss most! We always had big crowds cheering on our team. I would choose Foran if I had to do it over again, Foran is different from other schools because of the amount of opportunities given. Teachers and administration really play a key role into the students' development, not only academically, but also contribute into shaping who we are as people!"", 'Most teachers are amazing here! It a requirement that teachers have office hours, meaning time outside of the school day to help with students. I think this is something every school should have, not all students and teachers have free periods for extra help, and this aspect really gives one on one time between students and teachers. Teachers here are always asking for feedback from us, and wondering what they can do to improve our learning experience which is something a lot of teachers don\'t do. They treat us with respect and like the young adults we are instead of ""holding our hand"" like a lot of other teachers do.', 'Most students and staff at this school are caucasian', 'Academics at this school are pretty good and encourage students to look at the big picture instead of learning just straight up facts', 'Safety in this school is very important, but there is much security in terms of guards and what not.', ""Extracurricular activities are available to all students and many students participate in multiple clubs and sports at the same time.

I think all teachers are very approachable inside and outside the classroom. They make the school a very comfortable environment. In the classroom, they are very educated and are able to continue teaching effectively and make sure students understand the material they teach.', ""The teachers at my school are always there for students which is very beneficial since some may need extra help after school or during free periods. They are very connectable with the students and are always willing to work one-on-one with students. I really appreciate what my teachers do for me and the other students, because it's what helps us obtain a better education."", 'My experience at this school was a good one. I learned a lot and feel that I can be successful in college and beyond due to everything I got out of this school.', 'Some teachers work very hard and are willing to always help their students and others are a little more lazy and do not always give their all to their students.', 'I believe we are very safe. The school is strict on knowing where each student is at all times, along with visitors. There are continuous assemblies to inform us about our safety and decisions that we make. Even though there has been some safety concerns among our town in other schools, our school is definitely of the safest.', ""There is always somebody encouraging you to join a club. Most clubs don't take up too much time but they are beneficial and help you form a better social life. There are so many options and the school always encourages new ideas. Most of the teachers are the head of the clubs which actually really helps, because the teachers are always there for us. demonstration is very stubborn and likes to make life difficult, but they are in our best interests."", 'The school has a lot of school spirit and definitely has a good amount of parent involvement. I would not choose to go to this school again. There are programs to stop bullying yet most of the bullies make up the programs. There is a lack of maturity and respect among peers in the school, not enough students respect the teachers. Majority of the teachers give an appropriate amount of work load and do their jobs well.', ""I do not believe the teachers are given enough freedoms to teach how they would like. The administration is strict and restrains the teachers from what they believe could be more beneficial to the students. Teachers lack the manner of being strict over disrespectful students, and some are too much of friends with the students. Most teachers have a good way of making sure the student keeps up good grades, yet that may be due to the grading policy. Many teachers don't focus on individual student needs enough.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

This school in particular is very competitive when it comes to athletics. Our varsity football team won the Long Island Champions title two years ago and last year they won the Suffolk County Champions Title. Not only this, but the environment of the school is very secure and safe. With constant security inside the building as well as outside, and even a police officer on patrol at the main entrance, the students are able to feel protected at all costs. The thing that would need change is the principle's role in the student's lives considering she hasn't done much to interact with the kids that attend this school."", 'Wish there was more guidance for college because I have no clue what to do and how to get my life started', 'I like everything about the school and the way the teachers interact with the students and they make every students feel welcome.

I think we have really good sports teams, but I don't know for sure."", 'Very rare to find a good teacher (cough* math *cough). there’s a lot of ap and college classes offered which is good but I don’t feel all that prepared besides from what I’ve done on my own. There’s definitely a sense of superiority when it comes to certain sports or clubs that shouldn’t be there. People don’t seem motivated to try hard enough here.', 'Lindenhurst senior high school was a great school overall. It has a lot of great teachers and classes but also some teachers that didn’t really care about the students.', 'I feel as though I got a very good education. The teachers at LHS are great and they offer lots of different classes to satisfy different interests. I was able to take 11 AP classes throughout high school allowing me to enter college as a sophomore. The school itself is in pretty bad shape with water damage, leaks, etc. There are also a lot of mice running around. The funding to sports/clubs is not even with some departments getting much more than others.', 'Lindenhurst Senior High School is a great school for your children to attend. The administration does everything they possibly can to make your kids feel safe, the teachers are out for the benefit of your children, and it is a great place to make friends and learn.', 'The teachers were very motivated to develop student success. Unfortunately, the town has suffered since Hurricane Sandy, and it shows in the resources available to students. As the case has been with the youth on Long Island... drug use was a real issue, and I myself lost several classmates to overdoses.', 'The school protects certain individuals from any sort of repercussions, and the staff have obvious biases. Quite a few teachers do not care for teaching correctly they just want their next paycheck. The school is filled with ignorant and rude individuals, whom I doubt will ever mature thanks to the lack of guidance or school provides. Another unforgivable aspect of this schools administration is that they care more about funding sports than education.', 'My experience at this school is very well. I had a lot of great times. I met most of my best friends and had lot of my favorite moments in my life and found some of my best till modles.', 'So far my experience has been great here only slight problems but nothing major love it there.

The teacher is amazing and always willing to help and she works very hard daily.', 'I enjoyed having the opportunity of joining many programs at my high school, especially the MCJROTC. This gave me the ability to have access to explore my interests but, there is a large drug issue at my school. Probably more then 50% of the kids I go to school with either smoke cigarettes or interact with some type of drug on their free time. This problem has gotten so radical that it has lead to deaths. Along with this the mental state of a lot of the students at my high school does not seem to be positive at all. There are definitely changes that need to be made at Lindenhurst High School but without it I wouldnt be who i am today.', 'My experience was not as great as others. I staged a walk out for gun violence at my school and all of the students who participated in it had gotten suspended. It took for the governor to call to say that they couldn’t discipline us to stop the heckling. I always fought for the students, but the administration was the worst. The teachers supported our decisions. The teachers were the best, very friendly and a great advisor, . The guidance office could’ve been more experienced and helpful.', ""What's memorable about Lindenhurst High School is the tenacity and determination of teachers to not only provide a better education for students but to also provide a safe and comfortable environment. It's clear that the quality of education is excellent. However, I personally believe that the administration doesn't always accommodate to the needs of the students as well as fail to persistently push an academic agenda to their students. It is also apparent that Lindenhurst High School cares more about some sports than others."", 'Lindenhurst High School is the image of an ""All-American High School"" that you\'ve always dreamed about.  The school is large, but teachers tend to genuinely care about their students, with some real standouts who push kids to strive for more. The school facilities are unfortunately dated, as it dates to the 1960s, and while college admissions has gained much more focus in recent years, it still lags behind many schools of the North Shore.

Without my guidance counselor I definitely would not have accomplished much after high school ended. Every teacher I have had pushed me harder every day. If they saw you succeed then they would continue to give you more and more to further yourself. If you stumbled they would be more than happy to stay after school and work on every little problem to truly grasp the content.

The academics are     decent as well, although I wish there were more classes centered on teaching teens real life skills that will help them later on. One of my biggest wishes for this school is a bigger connection with guidance counselors. Planning out schedules for the 4 years students will be learning here is very stressful and not easy to do.

The staff just made things better as they were extremely nice.', 'Coming into high school as a timid freshman, I was petrified. Mostly because basically all of my friends were going to a different high school, and I was quite alone. This high school has gotten a pretty negative rep, and when I found out I had to attend this school I was crushed. However, after few months, I began to find my niche. I joined  a few clubs, and this school offers a plethora of different student and faculty run organizations. Within these clubs, I made new friends and developed new interests.  Overall, Roselle Park High School has provided me countless opportunities to grow as a person and discover what makes me tick.

The teachers and staff are so friendly and make you comfortable being there. Students are hard working and most know what they want to do in life and strive for their goals, which is a great thing to have. Rphs is a small high school, consisting of about 600 students, so all the students know each other. Because of the smaller size classes, teachers can focus on each student’s needs which is primary to the growth of students academics. The food is also DELICIOUS, the cafeteria mainly serve healthy foods which is also prior to the growth of students physically. The one thing I would change would have to be the amount of homework each student gets. Every student differs in what they do before and after school, so maybe a ton of work would work for some students while it may be tiring for others. Balance of play and work is key to the growth of students academically, physically, mentally, and even spiritually.', 'I enjoyed my time at the high school so far.  I would like to see more diversity among students and staff', 'Since I attended Roselle Park High, I have grown it a young man. The teachers took me under their wings and guided me. I play three sports in Football, Basketball and Baseball . The coaches and staff treats everyone as a equal pushing the students along.  Roselle Park will always been my high school home.', 'Being a small school (~ 500 students), it is thought that resources and opportunities are limited. However, the teachers and the principal are so willing to help students pursue whatever they would like, and they work hard for us. If we wish to enroll in college classes as a senior, they work hard to help us be able to do so. The resources are there, but we have to be the ones to reach out. That being said, as long as we are striving for the best and we put the effort in, we are able to get so much out of our high school experience. For example, when I told my principal what computer programs NJIT (my future university) uses in their school of architecture, she contacted the board of education and was able to have those professional programs installed on our school computers. It was so helpful to be able to work in those programs that year and have that exposure to gain better understanding and confidence.

The diversity in the school was the best part about the school. I feel that diversity, especially in school districts and in communities, are important because its good to have ""a dip in culture"" for many purposes. Although, the diversity is well throughout the school, one thing that I would like to change is the learning platform. I feel that that are school is not the same as the other school districts and that is a big disadvantage for students to get all the information they need for their future careers.', 'It’s a small school, which allows for a comfortable environment amongst students, teachers, and staff.', 'Great School!

I consider it academically demanding and teachers are strict and passionate about their work. My high school years have been a great learning and growing experience for me. RPHS  has given me the tools to feel confident I can succeed in my future endeavors.', 'Roselle Park highschool is the school of all different kinds of experiences.

With all the drama and bullying, but I found the complete opposite. Friendly people, very diverse, and in all just enjoyable. Made life time memories and friends, and actually enjoyed going to the school. The staff just made things better as they were extremely nice.', 'Coming into high school as a timid freshman, I was petrified. Mostly because basically all of my friends were going to a different high school, and I was quite alone. This high school has gotten a pretty negative rep, and when I found out I had to attend this school I was crushed. However, after few months, I began to find my niche. I joined  a few clubs, and this school offers a plethora of different student and faculty run organizations. Within these clubs, I made new friends and developed new interests.  Overall, Roselle Park High School has provided me countless opportunities to grow as a person and discover what makes me tick.

The teachers and staff are so friendly and make you comfortable being there. Students are hard working and most know what they want to do in life and strive for their goals, which is a great thing to have. Rphs is a small high school, consisting of about 600 students, so all the students know each other. Because of the smaller size classes, teachers can focus on each student’s needs which is primary to the growth of students academics. The food is also DELICIOUS, the cafeteria mainly serve healthy foods which is also prior to the growth of students physically. The one thing I would change would have to be the amount of homework each student gets. Every student differs in what they do before and after school, so maybe a ton of work would work for some students while it may be tiring for others. Balance of play and work is key to the growth of students academically, physically, mentally, and even spiritually.', 'I enjoyed my time at the high school so far.  I would like to see more diversity among students and staff', 'Since I attended Roselle Park High, I have grown it a young man. The teachers took me under their wings and guided me. I play three sports in Football, Basketball and Baseball . The coaches and staff treats everyone as a equal pushing the students along.  Roselle Park will always been my high school home.', 'Being a small school (~ 500 students), it is thought that resources and opportunities are limited. However, the teachers and the principal are so willing to help students pursue whatever they would like, and they work hard for us. If we wish to enroll in college classes as a senior, they work hard to help us be able to do so. The resources are there, but we have to be the ones to reach out. That being said, as long as we are striving for the best and we put the effort in, we are able to get so much out of our high school experience. For example, when I told my principal what computer programs NJIT (my future university) uses in their school of architecture, she contacted the board of education and was able to have those professional programs installed on our school computers. It was so helpful to be able to work in those programs that year and have that exposure to gain better understanding and confidence.

I was involved in many activities, as much as I can but I was all alone when applying for these opportunities. I wasn't given much help from my advisors, some teachers were very sexist and favored many boys. It's hard being a girl in this school because you have to try very hard to make yourself seen. It's not very sanitary, (at least in the bathrooms). There are good ways to get after-school activities and classes but you have to fight for them. The advisors won't help you, in fact, they seem set on making sure that you have an average high school experience.  I wanted a spectacular high school experience, with all the ap and honor classes I can get. My advisors wouldn't let me take the challenge and that definitely set me back this year.

I'm currently a senior, and my gals became like my sisters, and I can thank that to my Spanish Teacher, Mrs. Rios. Why, because this school honestly takes Communication as priority to the school, because that is what the world is based of. But, one thing they can alter a bit is try to also focus on giving time to family or precious life time.

Everyone is friendly and a lot of great opportunities are offered.', 'Entering my freshman year, I always thought that I wouldn\'t ""fit in"" with anyone and believed that I should stick alone to avoid drama. This idea was perceived by the movies and shows I watched before entering high school. Of course, all of that was squashed. High school was able to let me ""come out of my shell"" and truly express myself. Not only was I able to express myself but, nobody judged me or looked down upon me when I chose to do so. The classes are hard, but you get used to it a couple of months into it. The school is trying to prepare the student for independency and college readiness.', 'HPHS has taught me more than I could wish for, but my favorite aspect will always be my relationships with my teachers. They always go above and beyond to help me, and truly personalize my education. My teachers know me, and I know them, and for that I am thankful. They are there to listen and to provide feedback too. I’ve taken 4 AP classes so far and am taking 2 more this year, aware of the fact that some schools don’t have AP classes at all. I am also very grateful for the CDI College Office, and their wonderful help on my college applications.', ""The Spanish department is not the best and only 1 teacher (Chase) is actually good. It's hard to change classes here and the hallways are BEYOND CROWDED. It's insane how much traffic there is, regardless of what period. There are only a handful of decent teachers. You're only allowed to take 1 AP class during Sophomore year (AP World) and if there's no seat, you're in tough luck. All the classes are jammed pack and theres no seat to transfer in or out of."", 'I like the classes Health Professions offers and the fact that the schedule varies. I wish the Schoo would let us go out for lunch though.', 'This school is not a union. There are times they try to be but for the most part, it feels as though the teachers are not there to benefit the students. Some specific teachers are very helpful whether its mentally or academically, but overall, the school needs to do better.', 'I would like to see better security, because of the few school that are in the said building, no one could tell if a student should be in or our of school. would also like teachers who speak English clearly why teaching. communications between teachers and parents should be better..', 'My experience at HPHS was good. The school was very diverse which made getting comfortable easy and the staff work very hard to make sure you are doing your best academically.', ""I'm currently a senior at this high school.

I’ve had many positive and memorable experiences with the students, as well as the staff members, who I have developed close relationships with. They’re very approachable, caring and are always willing to help if you are struggling. One of the many things that make this school unique is the science research and medical assisting program. As part of the medical assisting program, I’ve been able to gain internships at various medical institutions throughout the city during my two years. One thing that I would like to see changed is more involvement in extracurricular activities, such as clubs and sports. In addition, more AP classes should be offered and the school should be made a little cleaner.', 'It is a school where you can grow as a human being and there are great people there that can help you develop into the person you want to be for when college arrives.', 'What I like about HPHS is how diverse it is.

For example, when I first came to this school, I tried out for the volleyball team and instantly made friends with the other girls on the team. Years later, I am still friends with most of those girls. I also joined other clubs such as gaming club and makeup club that also allowed me to meet new people. What I don't like as much about my school is that it's not exactly the cleanest.

All the teachers know who you especially if you are like me who has a great heart but gets in trouble once in a while. The teachers are able to focus on the students who are kind of struggling and are really hard on students. A major reason is that students are prepared for college.

The teachers are able to focus on the students who are kind of struggling and are really hard on students. A major reason is that students are prepared for college.

The school focuses less on extrinsic motivators such as grades and is very content based through the uses of a mastery based grading system, that assess the students on skills.The school has an incredible diversity, being a majority low-income family school. I feel the community at AFSE is incredible, and its clubs are reason for this. As VP the Model Congress, I've seen first hand the incredible commitment that students have. Enthusiasm has run our club to compete at the best colleges on the east coast. A small public school from Manhattan facing off  the best private schools, and we walk home with awards. If you want to make a new club, Student Gov makes it easy.

And another probably would be if your looking to go into the next level in sports, then this school probably shouldn\'t be your first choice.

Administration often institutes policies that upset both students and teachers.

Most teachers are more obsessed grades and memorization instead of actual learning. Some teachers are forced to teach subjects they do not want or don't know, and make it known to the students. There is a lack of variety in Advanced Placement, honors, and College level classes. School administrators are more often motivated by money rather than what is better for the students. There is no pep-rally, homecoming dance, or senior trip.

On the other hand there are a few out there who don't seem to really care about your well being or anything except their paycheck at the end of each month. Moving onto sports, we're not really good at anything related to athletics except for badminton where we had a streak of 504 consecutive wins spanning over 32 years, yeah it's a world record.

On the other hand there are a few out there who don't seem to really care about your well being or anything except their paycheck at the end of each month.

I was wrong.  I am extremely disappointed in the lack of care and poor attitude from the entire school district.  Jackson Memorial High School is full of mean girls, bullies, drugs and teachers that are there just waiting to clock out for summer.  The do not emulate the adults we would hope our children to grow up to be.  Students are left to teach themselves in many instances because the teachers roam the halls during class time more than the students do.  Older Varsity sports students are not only on drugs, they peer pressure the newer students into it as well.  Is it society or the lack of school administration?  A terrible experience all together.  The ceilings leak, bathrooms are a safe haven for drug use, sales, sex and bullying, and building conditions only mirror the teaching staff and administration.  One year at this school and I am pulling my child out.  The last day cannot come soon enough!', ""Best school for the cost of local taxes.

The academics are well above average with some of the best teachers teaching many different subjects. Sports is a big pride at JMHS with very successful football, wrestling, soccer, and baseball programs. Coaches get the best out of their players in addition to keeping their grades in line. JMHS does a great job of preparing students for college by offering many Advanced placement classes. These classes can be accepted at select universities based on the grade received in the class.', 'This school is like any other average high school. Most teachers did their best to allow the students to succeed. The school had many different groups that students could be a part of. There was a separation though between the students. It was created due to the type of classes a person took. Being regular, honors, or ap. Whichever group you were in forced a person to be stuck with only those people in their classes all throughout high school. Electives being the only except, everyone was mixed. Food was decent and the school had great winning sports.', 'Jackson Memorial High School is a diverse but unified school.

Between sports, activities, and arts there is really something for everyone to join. There are also some really special teachers that make an impact on their students. I have thoroughly loved my experience and will be devastated to leave.', 'Jackson Memorial High school is a great school and being a senior I really enjoyed and will miss my time served here. The teachers are great and will do anything in order to help you learn. I feel safe everyday and the school has a very positive environment. The sports teams are great and the extra curricular activities are endless. It is a really clean school, fill with people who want to get better everyday.', 'Going from a catholic school to a public school, no words could describe the amount of fear I had inside. However, the staff and students in the Jackson School District made me feel nothing but comfortable. While attending this school for 4 years, I made some many unbreakable bonds with students that I now call family and teachers that have helped me build success. The theme of tradition at JMHS is something I will carry with forever  because it taught me nothing but family and fun.', 'It’s just like any other high school. I’d like better heating because the school is always freezing.', 'Wonderful and caring teachers. Incredible school spirit and pride. I always felt proud to be a Jaguar. The sports were out of this world and I was proud to be a Jackson Memorial Jaguar Cheerleader.', 'I like the variety of classes available to take, there are challenging opportunities as well as many electives. I also have really liked most of teachers and believe they have had a big impact on my education.', 'My overall experience at Jackson Memorial High School has been about average. The classes I am taking are setting me up to do my best at a college level. The teachers who teach the AP classes are dedicated to the students and go above and beyond to help the students prepare for the AP tests in May. They put in long hours helping us study and help us do our best. The food at school is another story. It is not very good and I prefer to bring my lunch from home daily, but that is just my personal opinion. The school also has a wonderful award winning band and football team.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['The school had an unbelievable amount of school spirit.

I would ask to change the clubs time since some students have class afterschool and can’t always participate.

The diversity in this school is definitely astonishing. Students vary from all different races, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability, age, and even sexual orientation yet everyone is still treated equally which I personally think is the best aspect of the school. The opportunities that the school provides to help the transition into college easier such as college readiness programs, College Now courses, college trips are very beneficial because there's so much support given to us. I really don't think the school has to change at all but if I could improve one thing, it would be the number of sports that are provided because there isn't a lot and I think everyone would enjoy it if they had more options to choose from."", 'I love my school. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to stay, and that was during my freshman year, but as time started to pass by, things started to get better.  The teachers are so supportive and respect every single student. We have so many celebrations for different cultures throughout the school year and that’s something I really appreciate. Our school is rated the second best in the district and I think that is something to brag about.', 'My experience with University Neighborhood High School was having great counselors. Having someone who you can reach out to when you have questions or just need to talk toSomeone. Being acceptable for who you are and being in a safe zone, the counselors check up with you. Asking for help if you want to know how your grades are or if you want to check a recent grade in the past or any credits missing. They listen and help you out directly to your problem and also create an open space for students to come in and feel free to discuss on goals you want to do for yourself. I would ask to change the clubs time since some students have class afterschool and can’t always participate. Lots of students would want to join a sport or club but can’t since they are busy with academic studies, which is beneficial but sometimes students are overwhelmed and would love to attend something they enjoy. Expanding time for clubs would make things more balance for students.', ""I am currently a senior at University Neighborhood High School. So through the last three and a half years I got to explore and learn a lot thanks to UNHS. They made me feel accepted with their diversity and because its a small school with about 500 student and still with its own building of five floors, I had never felt left out. Its a great environment, you feel like you know everyone and they know you. The teachers are always there to support you, they're more like your friends, someone that you could always talk to. I don't know about other schools, but my school pushes students to strive at their best and push towards higher education no matter what your identity or background is."", 'Even though this school is small, it has a lot of opportunities. The colleges classes are great to get a head start before we go to college. This school is also really dedicated to lead their students to success. Teacher are always there to help if you need anything, even if its not school related. We have many clubs and activities such as dance team, basketball team, handball, debate club, student government, art club, music club, etc. The only thing that would probably need change is the size of the school, its really small and we have a lot of new students which makes it even crowded.', 'When I attended at UNHS it was an amazing experience.

It was very difficult for a student to fail at UNHS.', 'University Neighborhood High School is a place to be when you want to meet new people outside of your cultural background.', ""Teachers there are amazing!

Considering that this school is small, it  is really welcoming and non over whelming. It you want your child to have more 101 and intimate relationships with their peers and students this is the place to be. One thing I love about this school is that they offer so many great programs, including Deloitte Academy. One thing I would change about this school is the amount of AP courses offered here, they only have one AP class  here and I wish there were more.', ""I felt really supported at this school.

Stating that the rape culture does not exist while they close the decent bathroom on a one floor high school because they are afraid student will smoke in there leaving student to suffer in a roach and mold infested bathrooms. Other than that you you really try to apply yourselves to the work you may gain some knowledge from the school.', 'The school as a who is great but there are a few problems. The problems are food is terrible and need to go out side to the restaurants or food carts to get good lunch and t the laptops in the school are not the most functional. but other then this the rest of the school is great.', 'there are a lot of good things about museum.  Lots of diversity, small class sizes (average around 20), and some really good teachers. However, we have very little clubs, an arrogant dean and an extremly high teacher turn over rate.', 'The teachers really care about learning and are the best part of the school. If you really want to learn this is a great, small school under the radar of many in the know of the NYC high school scene.The extra curriculars are scarce but the great academics make up for it.', 'During my time at NYC Museum School, I met some genuine and amazing people. There were certainly students who really did well academically, however there needed to be more resources available. Most of the teachers were hardly accessible and the administration was quick to shut down any idea that the students had. Also, there needs to be more help during the college process  including essay writing workshops, information sessions on colleges, student panels and scholarship opportunities. This wold prove to give students more of an insight into college and think smartly about where they really want to go. The school has great diversity however, there was a scanty amount of clubs and activities to get students involved in the school atmosphere. By allowing students to make their own clubs and actually have the support of the administration, students would be able to really delve into their interests and feel more at home in school.', 'At the school, there is Module which is a program that all students participate from 9th-grade to 11th-grade where students learn about a topic through the average classroom teaching as well as through going on trips to museums and other similar instuitutions. This is one thing I found interesting and most of the time fun, about the school. One thing that the school was seriously lacking however was clubs and fun electives that encouraged student interaction in the school, with the teachers and other students.', ""Overall my experience in NYC Museum School was pretty exciting. I've made many new friends over the courses of years and I've had fun them. There are also teachers that have made learning enjoyable for me in the school, which I am grateful for. However, few teachers seems undedicated to their job- they ignore the students who play with their phone during their classes and barely teach the class about anything that's useful about the course. I won't point out which teachers, but I sincerely hopes that they start paying more attention to their students' learning or else they should just quit the job and let someone else take over."", 'i loved the trips and the teachers are amazing but the administration is terrible. The teachers really want to see you succeed and will go out there way to help you but you wont really come in contact with the principal. Only like 3 times a year. But the trips every wednesday really did make the school bearable', 'This school is considered average for academics, there is a lack of clubs and other extracurricular, but gives you a different learning experience because of the weekly trips.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

The guidance department tries its best, but with so many kids (approx.2000) it’s so hard for them to organize ways to effectively work with students who aren’t necessarily problematic. Faculty is amazing, there’s a mix of teachers which generally tends to be knowledgeable and patient.The administration is so and so, at times they focus to much on the image of the school (20 minutes long lipdubs) rather than strive to improve the education and solve other problems.

Some teachers realize that not every student learns the same way and have come up with multiple ideas to help the student excel in class such as offering one on one meetings after school to help them comprehend the lesson more in depth. The academics is great, they offer a wide variety of classes ranging from college prep to honors to advanced placement. The sports and school spirit is amazing.

They have created the “open-door” environment in hopes of each student feeling comfortable to be able to confide in them when struggling academically and emotionally.

I love that it’s very diversified and has a lot involvement within our community. I enjoy being a part of Colonia’s  soccer and basketball team.

However, there many things that can be done to make the school better. The school lunch has made me sick more times than I can count, and they ought to higher better services (like DJs) for school events. Also, when a student is being treated unfairly, it is ignored. For example, when a student wore an off-shoulder top she was forced to change, but the teachers said nothing to other students who wore shorts that barely covered their rear ends.', 'Colonia is a school with lots of school spirit and student engagement. You get a good sense of community at CHS. Colonia offers an array of clubs, societies, and athletic programs for its students.

My favorite part about this school is the diversity in the students that go there, no matter who you are, or where you come from, you will always find a group of people that you could relate to. Although, the one thing I would like to change about this school is how strict they are. you can get in trouble for doing practically anything that is even to the slightest degree offensive, even if nobody was offended.', 'Most of the teachers at Colonia high school are very caring and will do everything they can to help you succeed.', 'If you are looking for an open-minded and innovative environment, CHS is the place for you. You just must be clear with what you want. We have so many amazing clubs and sports. Students come from all over the world. And the teachers are legendary!', 'I met a lot of new and different people and made many friends.  Teachers treated students professionally for the most part.  There were many fun clubs and activities one could join after school in which both students and teachers were very enthusiastic in. The only downside would be the students (behaviour-wise).  A good amount of students the ""didn\'t really care"", cutting class, being rude in general, not receiving the discipline they needed.  However, the teachers and staff would usually do their best to discipline such students.  The only downside to that would be (NOT all teachers- some in particular) a negative attitude towards most students.Another thing that would be best improved would be the Gym class.  Not all classes were equally active (certain periods would literally just walk/ sit around while others would play more sports/ do more activities).', 'Overall Colonia High is a great school. They have good clubs and activities as well as good staff member. They are all daily kind and help students out.', ""Colonia High school had its ups and downs. They push you hard if your are a student athlete which shouldn't be the case. All students should be focused on equally. Colonia has a lot to offer for future college students with options of college classes and AP courses which any student can choose to take freely."", 'I enjoy the diversity Colonia High School brings to its student. There is a wide array of student activity and opportunity for involvement. If not sports, students are given the chance to try art, music, or chorus. Colonia High School gives a great amount of opportunity to each and every student. To make Colonia High School even greater, I would encourage more funding to be put into education and the tools needed for kids to receive education such as books and technology.', 'The school, itself, is very good. There are little things that can be done to improve it, but there are no major flaws in the school.', 'I really enjoyed my high school experience. Our faculty is amazing: they are all so passionate about what they do and it reflects onto their students. It was not hard for me at all to find where I belong and I made friends very easily. There are so many opportunities to get involved and most students take advantage of them. In the past years it has gotten better, but I wish there was some more support for the arts. Sports are great, but they often overshadow the arts. Also there is sometimes a lack of communication between administration and the teachers or between the teachers and students. Also I wish we received some more help while going through the college application process. Overall though, it was four years I enjoyed and will never forget.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Colonia provided me with a lot of extracurricular activities for me to get involved.

Additionally, McMahon is beginning to implement the IB diploma program and has begun offering it to its students. I think the faculty at Brien McMahon could be better.

The format of some of the classes such as AP courses prepare students for the college format, the diversity of the clubs allows for anyone to find something they're interested in, and there are plenty of events that happens during the year the breaks up the monotony of the average high school work cycle. The teachers and other staff are all very competent at their jobs and care for their students success; I have personally seen teachers go out of their way to help students that are struggling just for them to rebound and be some of the more successful students within the school. I have never felt a day that I was in danger walking into Shore Regional, and this is because of the overall feeling of security and because of the work done by the security team who helps make thins run smoothly."", ""Overall, Shore Regional provided a very good high school experience. It got better as the years progressed. As I didn't have a positive experience with the Freshman Football program, sports were not part of high school life. Also, as a classified (504) student, lots of extra-curricular activities were not in the picture - difficult enough to handle the course requirements. The band was my cultural experience and I believe deserves a lot more support. My guidance counselor was great as well - supportive and understanding. For friends who didn't struggle as much with their academics, Shore offered a really competitive and recognized athletic program and plenty of clubs and activities. Even though I was not as involved as I would've liked to have been, I will always be a Blue Devil at heart. I know I received a very good overall education and high school experience at Shore."", 'I enjoyed my time here at shore regional while also realizing that there is much to improve on.

The administration is hard to work with, too.Besides that, diversity is great in Becton. Much of the staff is filled with positivity. I've made great connections with classmates and faculty.

Even the better part is when you need a friend or someone to talk to they are always around.', 'Throughout my years at Weehawken High School, it is safe to say that this school helped me grow into the person I am today. Weehawken offers you many opportunities to take AP and Honors courses which is was very helpful.', 'Weehawken High School is a very small and diverse school compared to other schools in the area.  Everyone knows each other, which provides a feeling of community and family here.  It is a great academic experience which affords its students a multitude of opportunities in honor classes, AP classes, and clubs.  I do feel as though Weehawken High School has done a lot to prepare me for life outside of high school and get me ready for college.   However, I do think that the school can improve on its extracurricular activities.  The quality of these programs are poor due to the lack of funding and results.  Overall, I have had a great time being a student at Weehawken and would recommend the school to anyone else in the area.', 'I believe that the high school experience could be better with more funding. Though this year they have started to just in 2019-2020 school year that they have been adding more clubs, but both sports and clubs should be better funded. Also, the band could use more funding as well.', 'Weehawken High School would seem pretty sucky to those who grew up here, but in comparison to the other schools in the surrounding areas, it’s one of the better options. The education isn’t the greatest, but it’s also not terrible. I will say that it does not really prepare you for college though. The academics aren’t really all that diverse so there aren’t many opportunities to explore different areas of interest. I had a very hard time figuring out what I wanted to major in for a very long time and It wasn’t until I was given the student director position that it all became very clear. If I wasn’t given that position I would probably still be undecided and be figuring out a lat minute major that I wouldn’t really be too happy in.', 'Overall, I think Weehawken High School is a school that has been on the rise recently due to the advancements in things such as the STEM curriculum along with the increased variety of the AP courses offered. There are also new teachers being hired into the school that provide a breath of fresh air in terms of teaching, along with the already established teachers here that provide the experience. This school is also relatively small when compared to other schools in the area, so almost everyone knows each other, and provides a feeling of family here.

The teachers were generally nice, but of them were really useless and the office people were usually mean and rude. Some of the office people often gossiped about students which was really childish and wrong.

The school could do to show more expectation in all of their students in order to increase the overall academic growth of all students who attend. While the school has recently attempted an increase in AP course participation, which is a positive improvement, these efforts seem to be lacking in the heart of improving the student learning experience, seemingly more concerned with raising the school's state and national ranking for the sake of raising funding and town property values.If additional educational resources are added and grown AND consistent care towards every students' growth shown in every class, then the new improvements can truly make Weehawken High School a great school."", 'Personally what I liked about Weehawken high was that it was a small school so everyone knew everyone. It was easy to communicate with one another. I made very special friends at school and I know I could carry them along once I graduate.', ""Some of these teaches are phenomenal.

While being in this school i have never felt accepted or like I ""fit in"". In this school. teachers favorite the kids who are popular and have had older brothers and sisters as students. The name teachers and students give you whether it is true or not sticks with you till you graduate. This is the hardest place to make friends being that everyone has cliques and favorites. Favoritism is also an issue in sports. If you are not the IT girl/boy you won\'t be on the team. Simple as that. Other than that if you are willing to learn and pay attention at Weehawken High you will get an average education.', 'Overall, it is a private education within a public school. The English Department, e.g. Mantineo, McCormick, Kitzie, and Emmolo are extremely strong. Murduca is a great instructor for math classes. Previous administration was a bit shady, but ultimately a really good school.', 'I definitely believe that the Weehawken high school is one of the best high school in New jersey, When i first transferred to the Weehawken high school during half way of my freshman year and it was really scary , but thanks to my lovely guidance counselor , she brought some stupids that would love to show me around the school , and one of those girls turned out to be one of my best friends, everyone in the school makes you feel welcomed ,and respectful , and I adore all the sweet staff and teachers there, there always there to help you out and give you chances when you need them, Theres so much the school has to offer.', 'I believe the past 6 years that I have spent at Weehawken High School has been the best education a student can receive. The staff is very helpful and kind and try their very best to teach their students to the fullest of their abilities. The school itself is located in a small area so everyone is familiar with one another. We are a very close knit community and with the help of the new principal, Weehawken High School is improving more and more by the year.', 'The teachers are really friendly, and they work hard towards helping the students to learn.

They try all of their best to do everything they can to help the students learn.', ""This school is great my son played football for 4 years and all I have to say is everyone made sure all the kids had school grades up before anything. It's like family if they see a child struggling they warn the parent ASAP and together we make sure he's back on track. I love that"", 'The school is great academic wise. There are many other programs that students with me right GPA can get into more qualified for. There are also great teachers that teach these classes and make learning fun and exciting.

If I wasn’t given that position I would probably still be undecided and be figuring out a lat minute major that I wouldn’t really be too happy in.', 'Overall, I think Weehawken High School is a school that has been on the rise recently due to the advancements in things such as the STEM curriculum along with the increased variety of the AP courses offered. There are also new teachers being hired into the school that provide a breath of fresh air in terms of teaching, along with the already established teachers here that provide the experience. This school is also relatively small when compared to other schools in the area, so almost everyone knows each other, and provides a feeling of family here. However, some things I think the school can improve on are extracurricular activities, as the quality of these is overall poor due to lack of funding and results. In conclusion, I would recommend Weehawken High School to anyone looking to move here because of the reasons above.', ""Weehawken High School, was something totally new for me coming for a big town and to now living in a town that everyone knows each other. Weehawken has its positives and negative, but I have a love hat relationship with the fact that high school is a very small school. being that it's such a small school allow students to have a more hands on learning experience. I don't like that since we are such a small school, we do not have a lot of sports that majority of schools would have."", 'I liked that the school was fairly small and everyone knew each other in some way. The teachers were generally nice, but of them were really useless and the office people were usually mean and rude. Some of the office people often gossiped about students which was really childish and wrong. Some advisers were really helpful and nice but it was often better to figure things out on your own, especially for college.', ""Weehawken High School was the best high school that I had ever attended. The school could do to show more expectation in all of their students in order to increase the overall academic growth of all students who attend. While the school has recently attempted an increase in AP course participation, which is a positive improvement, these efforts seem to be lacking in the heart of improving the student learning experience, seemingly more concerned with raising the school's state and national ranking for the sake of raising funding and town property values.If additional educational resources are added and grown AND consistent care towards every students' growth shown in every class, then the new improvements can truly make Weehawken High School a great school."", 'Personally what I liked about Weehawken high was that it was a small school so everyone knew everyone. It was easy to communicate with one another. I made very special friends at school and I know I could carry them along once I graduate.', ""Some of these teaches are phenomenal. They've changed me for life. But this administration is a joke. They lie like crazy. This school isn't what they make it out to be. It is the best in Hudson County, but that's because of the hard working teachers and students. Not the admin."", 'Weehawken High School has changed through my years learning there. Last year the student board decided to renovate the school by installing new doors, new lockers, and a brand new courtyard in the front entrance of the school. Everyone in the community is amazing, fantastic, helpful, and, most importantly, your friend.', 'FAVORITISM. Weehawken High is a small school. About 300 students attend. While being in this school i have never felt accepted or like I ""fit in"". In this school. teachers favorite the kids who are popular and have had older brothers and sisters as students. The name teachers and students give you whether it is true or not sticks with you till you graduate. This is the hardest place to make friends being that everyone has cliques and favorites. Favoritism is also an issue in sports. If you are not the IT girl/boy you won\'t be on the team. Simple as that. Other than that if you are willing to learn and pay attention at Weehawken High you will get an average education.', 'Overall, it is a private education within a public school. The English Department, e.g. Mantineo, McCormick, Kitzie, and Emmolo are extremely strong. Murduca is a great instructor for math classes. Previous administration was a bit shady, but ultimately a really good school.', 'I definitely believe that the Weehawken high school is one of the best high school in New jersey, When i first transferred to the Weehawken high school during half way of my freshman year and it was really scary , but thanks to my lovely guidance counselor , she brought some stupids that would love to show me around the school , and one of those girls turned out to be one of my best friends, everyone in the school makes you feel welcomed ,and respectful , and I adore all the sweet staff and teachers there, there always there to help you out and give you chances when you need them, Theres so much the school has to offer.', 'I believe the past 6 years that I have spent at Weehawken High School has been the best education a student can receive. The staff is very helpful and kind and try their very best to teach their students to the fullest of their abilities. The school itself is located in a small area so everyone is familiar with one another. We are a very close knit community and with the help of the new principal, Weehawken High School is improving more and more by the year.', 'The teachers are really friendly, and they work hard towards helping the students to learn. They try to find different ways to engage the students in learning. They try all of their best to do everything they can to help the students learn.', ""This school is great my son played football for 4 years and all I have to say is everyone made sure all the kids had school grades up before anything. It's like family if they see a child struggling they warn the parent ASAP and together we make sure he's back on track. I love that"", 'The school is great academic wise. There are many other programs that students with me right GPA can get into more qualified for. There are also great teachers that teach these classes and make learning fun and exciting.

The school always helps out the students both academic and social skills.  The school has sponsored SAT prep classes and internship programs for the students.', ""I like the fact that HSCL keeps close contact with the parents. There isn't anything I would change."", 'My overall experience with the High School for Community Leadership is described as a school where people learn and obtain skills to use for real-life situations . I have made quite a lot of friends, and enjoyed spending time with them at the school events the school provided. (dances & trips) The teachers discipline the students to understand the right path to create better lives for ourselves. Students are not ashamed to talk with teachers about any problems associated with their schoolwork, life issues, and communication. Our principal is an excellent role model for students to look up to. He has provided information and created meetings for the existing 9 to 12 grade students to be prepared for what the year brings. It is an excellent school for any child to attend.', 'This school is amazing. We go on a lot of trips every year and they are phenomenal. I feel like I am ready for college and they have done an amazing job preparing me for the rest of my life. The amount of college tour trips they allow us to take every year really helps with us being ready to go off to college.', ""My experience at High School for Community Leadership over the past four years have been good. There have been times where i have experienced drama but over all, it is an outstanding school. the teachers are amazing. At High school for community leadership, we are all practically family. we treat each other like family and we have the upmost respect for each other. Yeah, sometimes kids argue with one another, but what family is perfect? What family doesn't argue with each other here and there?"", ""I've been going to Hscl for 4 years and it's been the best 4 years of my life. they do so much to keep students engaged."", 'High School for community leadership is a place of peace and safety; like any school it has its moments but the teachers are understanding and willing to work with you to make things work', ""My overall experience in High School for Community Leadership has been very fun. When I stepped into this school, I was extremely frightened because it was a school that I have never heard of before and it was in an area that I wasn't used to. Growing up, I went to schools where there was no diversity, only hispanics. So, this change from hispanics to Indians, Asians, African Americans, and White was huge! Furthermore, I consider HSCL fun because their goal is to have us students feel welcomed and to give us the best four-year experience. There's cool trips that students get to participate in, like, Puerto Rico, Barcelona, Bahamas, etc. I have participated in some of these trips and it has been amazing! One thing that I would like to see the school improve in is more SAT encouragement. There are some students who just don't care and it would be great if there was a bit more of encouragement."", 'Life is made up of adventures and confrontation of experiences. But all of these are not equally important and memorable. Most of them are unforgettable. My first day at school is the day that can never be forgotten. I was waiting for that day with so much anticipation, I had heard so many things about High school education from my older siblings and other family members.', 'i really like the school. this school is the first school in United states for me. i did know the rules at the beggining and after a year in that school i learned a lot of stuff. they help me to grow up and be confident. in my senior year i feel proud of my school because all the teachers are really great. they tought me how to speak. i could not talk english a lot. after couple years in my hih school i can speak thoroughly. In the end, I feel proud to be part of the high school for community leadership.', 'Best when it comes to mental health and mental health issues among students yet it is clear there is a lack of training, understanding, and community that helps students who begin to struggle while they are at the university. Without catching students early it could impact a class grade. A student can not fail a class at Harvard without major consequences. There needs to be some or more training for advisers, deans, teaching fellows and professors to watch for students who start to withdraw and are having mental health issues.', 'High School for Community Leadership is one of the best high school in the district. I am having a great experience here. The teachers and counselors are always helpful and respects and values their student. They also help students who are trying to overcome any sort of difficulties. I have a lot of friends in this high school and we learn new things every day as well as have fun. There is no bullying or racism. People respect each other diversity and also organizes cultural programs. Overall this high school has made me a better person and I will be always grateful for that.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['My experience at high school for community leadership has been pretty average.

The science and math departments are probably the strongest.', ""Most of the teachers at Pearl River High School are great. They go into work with an attitude to make a difference and will help anyone to achieve their goals. The teachers are all a bit different. Each teacher teaches differently. Some teachers don't rely on just power points and notes. These teachers bring in real world issues when possible in order to obtain attention. Other teachers use the textbook and give all the information. But instead of a boring lesson some teachers would try to make learning engaging and exciting. Some create quick fun games that attracts the class. Students would have a good time learning new things by playing a game. With a game students built team work. There are some teachers that just go from what's based on the textbooks. But the teachers that can go above and beyond always do. Teachers take time from their schedules in order to help students by creating an extra help session or even if the student needs to talk to the teacher individually. Most of the teachers are knowledgeable on what they teach. They have a passion for whatever subject it is they are teaching. They relate real world problems, sometimes their own problems of its applicable. The teachers and administration are remarkable at Pearl River high school. All the teachers give students the grade they earn. No student gets special treatment. Each student is always offered extra help and is always offered some type of help and its up to them to take it. Some do and some don't, and these teachers do more than they have to for those who struggle and don't take advantage of the opportunities."", ""The academics at this school are what you make of them. Most of the better teachers teach the honors or AP classes, so if you're just a regular student, you're not really getting the highest quality education. However, if you push yourself and get into the honors classes, you'll get a significantly better education than in the regular level classes. The guidance department really doesn't know what they are doing, and consistently screws up the schedules of good students who also want to take art or music classes. The workload is ridiculous for honors and AP kids, as many of these teachers will assign an hour's worth of homework, and that adds up to hours and hours of work every night. Most honors and AP kids haven't gotten a good night's sleep on a school night for years."", ""Most teachers are really good, and genuinely want their students to do well. However, some teachers are just unqualified for their positions. For example, there is a science teacher who teaches a college course who teaches the wrong information often. She got demoted from teaching honors biology because there were so many complaints about her, but for some reason she is still employed at the school, and teaching a college level class. On the other hand, there are some really great teachers, like Ms. King, who teaches AP biology. Although the class is fast paced and full of difficult curriculum, if you need help, Ms. King would always be glad to hold extra help sessions for students or just cover difficult topics again in class. For English, Mrs. Shepard, who teaches AP English Lit & Composition and English 10 Honors, is one of the best teachers. She truly has a love for her class, and really just wants to help students become better readers and writers. Mr. McNerney, who teaches RCC's College English class at Pearl River, is also awesome. He really prepares you for college, while still giving students the opportunity to succeed. Most teachers are pretty good."", ""Mrs. Willock, the school nurse, is awesome. She doesn't just send you back to class if you don't have a fever: if you don't feel well, she doesn't just automatically assume you're lying. She genuinely cares about the students and their health, and won't get mad at you for missing class if you honestly aren't feeling well. PR has two security guards, which basically do nothing but wave at people who drive into the school, but I suppose they serve their purpose of being there just so the school can say that they have security guards. There's a police officer who is usually stationed inside the school who's pretty chill, and I feel safer because he's there. Also, there are greeters at every door, but they're mostly little old ladies who couldn't scare away a fly, so I don't know who they're going to keep out. PR also has cameras at every main entrance so that the greeters can see whoever is trying to enter the building and remotely unlock the doors, or keep them locked if the person is questionable. PR is probably pretty safe though because it's in the middle of the most boring town in the world."", ""Our band, orchestra, and chorus are typically very good. However, we do not get nearly as much of the funding as athletics receive, which is absolutely unfair, because most sports teams at Pearl River are mediocre at best, with the exception of our boys varsity soccer team. Administration and the school board clearly favor athletics over art and music, as cuts are made in both departments, but cuts are rarely ever made in athletics, and when they are, the budget always magically adds the athletic aspects back into it for the next year. Youth and Government and Academic Team are definitely the best two clubs to be a part of. YAG gets to travel to Albany each March for the NYS conference, and it's a truly awesome experience. You can be a part of the judicial, legislative, or press branch and argue cases, write bills, or write the newsletter. A-Team gets to travel to different Rockland County high schools every Thursday, and answer fast-paced questions on just about every topic to compete for a county-wide trophy. At the end of the season, there is an invitational meet, and Pearl River's Academic Team actually came in second place at the invitational this year. However, A-Team and Youth and Government both receive almost no attention from administration, as neither of them involves kicking a ball into a goal."", 'This is a very safe community', 'There are very good extracurricular activities available at the school', 'The school has given me many opportunities.', 'The teachers are very available to the students.', 'The children who attend are rather harsh.', ""It's a nice place to grow up because it is so safe.

Most of the town is made up of Irish Catholics, and if you're not Irish, you tend to stick out at this school. Some of my favorite experiences at Pearl River are when we won the annual Little Brown Jug Game against our school's rival, Nanuet High School, and when I attended the Junior Prom this year, during both of which the school really banded together to become one."", 'The school is very safe. Bullying is almost non-existent. However, if bullying is found the administration acts swiftly and enforces the code of conduct. When infractions of the code are found people are frequently suspended even though infractions happen rarely. The underage drinking is a big problem at PRHS. Many students participate but rarely does any one get hurt or seriously ill due to this. One thing about PRHS that is good is that not a single person who I have met is part of a gang. Gang violence never takes place, as a matter of fact violence of any kind almost never takes place. PRHS is a very safe school.', 'The food at Pearl River is definitely not the highlight of the school. The sandwiches and salads are good, healthy options that also taste good. The hot lunches however do not taste very good. Most people avoid the hot lunch stand unless it is breakfast for lunch that day. One thing I do not notice at PRHS is an alternative option for people with allergies. This do not concern me as much as everything else however because I do not have many allergies but it is still something I would like to see changed.

Old murals are painted over and forgotten about which is upsetting. The only thing I would do over is work a little bit harder and participate in more sporting events.', 'Most of the teachers in this school are good at what they do but i feel as though I am not really prepared for the real world.', 'After graduating Pearl River High School I have to say the experience was great. I had a great time made great friends that I am still friends with today and could not say more about how amazing the education and athletic programs.', 'I believe the teachers in this school are devoted to their jobs and very helpful and knowledgeable in each of their designated fields of study.', 'It was very monotonous and useless information learned in most classes. It is very white school and very little diversity.', 'The science, Math and Social Study departments were the most knowledgeable and helpful. The english department needs some work there are a few teachers that should not be teaching because they do not care at all and grade based on who they like. There are some english teachers that go out of their way to help and I am beyond thankful for them. The science and math departments are probably the strongest.', ""Most of the teachers at Pearl River High School are great. They go into work with an attitude to make a difference and will help anyone to achieve their goals. The teachers are all a bit different. Each teacher teaches differently. Some teachers don't rely on just power points and notes. These teachers bring in real world issues when possible in order to obtain attention. Other teachers use the textbook and give all the information. But instead of a boring lesson some teachers would try to make learning engaging and exciting. Some create quick fun games that attracts the class. Students would have a good time learning new things by playing a game. With a game students built team work. There are some teachers that just go from what's based on the textbooks. But the teachers that can go above and beyond always do. Teachers take time from their schedules in order to help students by creating an extra help session or even if the student needs to talk to the teacher individually. Most of the teachers are knowledgeable on what they teach. They have a passion for whatever subject it is they are teaching. They relate real world problems, sometimes their own problems of its applicable. The teachers and administration are remarkable at Pearl River high school. All the teachers give students the grade they earn. No student gets special treatment. Each student is always offered extra help and is always offered some type of help and its up to them to take it. Some do and some don't, and these teachers do more than they have to for those who struggle and don't take advantage of the opportunities."", ""The academics at this school are what you make of them. Most of the better teachers teach the honors or AP classes, so if you're just a regular student, you're not really getting the highest quality education. However, if you push yourself and get into the honors classes, you'll get a significantly better education than in the regular level classes. The guidance department really doesn't know what they are doing, and consistently screws up the schedules of good students who also want to take art or music classes. The workload is ridiculous for honors and AP kids, as many of these teachers will assign an hour's worth of homework, and that adds up to hours and hours of work every night. Most honors and AP kids haven't gotten a good night's sleep on a school night for years."", ""Most teachers are really good, and genuinely want their students to do well. However, some teachers are just unqualified for their positions. For example, there is a science teacher who teaches a college course who teaches the wrong information often. She got demoted from teaching honors biology because there were so many complaints about her, but for some reason she is still employed at the school, and teaching a college level class. On the other hand, there are some really great teachers, like Ms. King, who teaches AP biology. Although the class is fast paced and full of difficult curriculum, if you need help, Ms. King would always be glad to hold extra help sessions for students or just cover difficult topics again in class. For English, Mrs. Shepard, who teaches AP English Lit & Composition and English 10 Honors, is one of the best teachers. She truly has a love for her class, and really just wants to help students become better readers and writers. Mr. McNerney, who teaches RCC's College English class at Pearl River, is also awesome. He really prepares you for college, while still giving students the opportunity to succeed. Most teachers are pretty good."", ""Mrs. Willock, the school nurse, is awesome. She doesn't just send you back to class if you don't have a fever: if you don't feel well, she doesn't just automatically assume you're lying. She genuinely cares about the students and their health, and won't get mad at you for missing class if you honestly aren't feeling well. PR has two security guards, which basically do nothing but wave at people who drive into the school, but I suppose they serve their purpose of being there just so the school can say that they have security guards. There's a police officer who is usually stationed inside the school who's pretty chill, and I feel safer because he's there. Also, there are greeters at every door, but they're mostly little old ladies who couldn't scare away a fly, so I don't know who they're going to keep out. PR also has cameras at every main entrance so that the greeters can see whoever is trying to enter the building and remotely unlock the doors, or keep them locked if the person is questionable. PR is probably pretty safe though because it's in the middle of the most boring town in the world."", ""Our band, orchestra, and chorus are typically very good. However, we do not get nearly as much of the funding as athletics receive, which is absolutely unfair, because most sports teams at Pearl River are mediocre at best, with the exception of our boys varsity soccer team. Administration and the school board clearly favor athletics over art and music, as cuts are made in both departments, but cuts are rarely ever made in athletics, and when they are, the budget always magically adds the athletic aspects back into it for the next year. Youth and Government and Academic Team are definitely the best two clubs to be a part of. YAG gets to travel to Albany each March for the NYS conference, and it's a truly awesome experience. You can be a part of the judicial, legislative, or press branch and argue cases, write bills, or write the newsletter. A-Team gets to travel to different Rockland County high schools every Thursday, and answer fast-paced questions on just about every topic to compete for a county-wide trophy. At the end of the season, there is an invitational meet, and Pearl River's Academic Team actually came in second place at the invitational this year. However, A-Team and Youth and Government both receive almost no attention from administration, as neither of them involves kicking a ball into a goal."", 'This is a very safe community', 'There are very good extracurricular activities available at the school', 'The school has given me many opportunities.', 'The teachers are very available to the students.', 'The children who attend are rather harsh.', ""It's a nice place to grow up because it is so safe. Everyone knows everyone so you are not just a number in the classroom but a face and a name."", ""Pearl River has a lot of great teachers and a pretty good class selection, but the student body is very small and one-dimensional. Most of the town is made up of Irish Catholics, and if you're not Irish, you tend to stick out at this school. Some of my favorite experiences at Pearl River are when we won the annual Little Brown Jug Game against our school's rival, Nanuet High School, and when I attended the Junior Prom this year, during both of which the school really banded together to become one."", 'The school is very safe. Bullying is almost non-existent. However, if bullying is found the administration acts swiftly and enforces the code of conduct. When infractions of the code are found people are frequently suspended even though infractions happen rarely. The underage drinking is a big problem at PRHS. Many students participate but rarely does any one get hurt or seriously ill due to this. One thing about PRHS that is good is that not a single person who I have met is part of a gang. Gang violence never takes place, as a matter of fact violence of any kind almost never takes place. PRHS is a very safe school.', 'The food at Pearl River is definitely not the highlight of the school. The sandwiches and salads are good, healthy options that also taste good. The hot lunches however do not taste very good. Most people avoid the hot lunch stand unless it is breakfast for lunch that day. One thing I do not notice at PRHS is an alternative option for people with allergies. This do not concern me as much as everything else however because I do not have many allergies but it is still something I would like to see changed. The lunch room itself is large with plenty of room for everybody who has lunch that particular period.

Keep in mind you are sharing the building with three high schools, an elementary school, and a daycare. You will build great relationships with your teachers who are always there to help you.', 'My experience at Frank McCourt High School was very average. I met wonderful people. However, at times it felt like I was not seen by the school staff.', 'When I went there we had some great teachers and just a great culture.  Now it seems to have regressed a bit after losing some great teachers and leaders in that school.', 'Frank McCourt is a public school in the Brandies campus located on 84th street. Frank McCourt is a very small school so teachers know their students very well and will always be able to help. That support will always be there.', 'Frank Mccourt is PBL school a project based Learning school which is  learning throughout different projects to master certain outcomes that will be assessed on different times throughout the semester. Frank Mccourt was very warm and welcoming but it also teaches us how to be more independent and it is', ""The school's environment is not your average high school. There wasn't enough college prep for students who were going to college out of the city. Since the high school didn't have a high budget, classrooms didn't have enough material for the students to use and  students would have to pay additional to go on trips."", 'Overall, my experience as a student at Frank McCourt has been good. Although we are not offered a variety of classes in subjects like language, math, ELA, and history, at the start of your high school year, it\'s a great way to get freshman initiated in their high school experience. Since it can be very difficult to choose classes for yourself. As you progress to become a junior, and eventually a senior, you will begin to see a spectrum of classes before your eyes. They have classes from programming, cancer studies, and even the study of the butterfly effect, which is a math credit. They also have this month dedicated as ""inter-session"", where students take one rigorous class a day, based on their interest of study. Some of these classes include; ""The Study of Cuteness"", ""Lotions and Potions"", and even ""Heroes and Myths""!', 'Frank McCourt High School is a school in which the teachers push you to work at a college level and prepare you not only for college, but for life itself. The classes can be challenging but the teachers will break it down so that everyone is on the same page. The students need to work on their spirit and enthusiasm to learn but other than that it is a great school.', 'Frank McCourt is an okay school, if I am honest. The classes are very rigorous however once you get into upper house the classes become like college courses.  The teachers are friendly and very attentive towards their students whenever you need help they are always there.', ""I liked the courses that they offered.  They had something to fit everyone's personality.  It is a very small & close knit school.  I would like to see more staff in the next year or so."", ""It's an average school. The teachers are nice and seem to care a great deal, however, the academics could be fixed. For example, there could be AP and Honors courses. That would be a great way to let students who actually care be able to thrive."", 'My 4 years here was an okay experience, not the best. Since it was a new school we did not have many resources. Every school year was different because they were trying to figure out the best method of teaching and the faculty was always changing. Bottom line is, they were inconsistent. I did appreciate their attempts to get the students ""college ready,"" but in my opinion I was not college ready at all. The faculty however were extremely welcoming and family-like. Everyone knew each other and the principal even memorized every student\'s name. They took their time to get to know us and were very accommodating whenever someone needed more help. The guidance counselors always went above and beyond in finding job, volunteer, and internship opportunities for students. Overall, this school taught me the true meaning of a community, but the ambiguity of what the next school year would be like is what I did not like about this school.', ""Overall, I've had an alright experience at Frank McCourt HS.  The key to a great school is the teachers that run the classes and at FMHS, the quality is very mixed.  I've had great experiences in  some classes and terrible experiences in others."", 'I had a wonderful time at this school, I had a very happy sad relationship in my final days last year. I had some of the most supportive teachers I have ever met and made great bonds that will last a lifetime. Frank McCourt taught me so many life skills. I feel that I was prepared very well for college. I loved the PGC program that the school offered, It was very nice to be able to work with the new students and give them tips and tricks for high school.', 'Frank McCourt has always had a diverse community for as long as I have been there. Myself and other students get as much support and help we need rather academically or personally.', ""I liked the challenges I faced within the school, it wasn't to hard but it wasn't easy either you had to work for that grade. What I would change is add more activities, they made it seem like it was easy to create a club but when I tried to do it from freshman year they finally finalized it senior year when I left even though it was approved freshman year. Also they need better organization skills the school was a mess."", ""I really love this school, the curriculum is very rigorous and demanding, but, overall I think that this helped me become a better student. I've learned a lot in the three years I have been going to this school and the teacher really make you feel that you can succeed through hard work and consistency. Along with that, the students are really nice and the community in each grade is very friendly within themselves. I can definitely say that I will miss this school once I graduate, but, I will also be very grateful for the life long lesson I will be taking with me as well."", ""FMHS offers you all the opportunities for you to be an excellent reader and writer but also a better student and human being. I feel the school prepares us for college in a moderate way, but I personally wish we had AP classes, but we can take College Now courses which are more challenging and like-university-classes which I really prefer. The teachers are always there to help you be and get better and I haven't  seen any type of violence or danger in the school, because the security is really coordinated and active. Also, Frank McCourt is not only a simple school but an actual community,  because, since we are such a small school, somehow it mixes us (whether during a potlock where we meet with other advisories of other grades or during Spirit Wekk) so we can meet other people, and this is way all students know each other inside the school. I do really like the school because it treats you like a young adult human being and always try to make us be the best we can be."", ""One thing I liked is the academics & the diversity of the school. You meet a lot of different people & that is a plus for a high school. One thing I don't like about the school is that they offer no AP classes, which bothered me.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Frank McCourt was a great high school.

Now it seems to have regressed a bit after losing some great teachers and leaders in that school.', 'Frank McCourt is a public school in the Brandies campus located on 84th street. Frank McCourt is a very small school so teachers know their students very well and will always be able to help. That support will always be there.', 'Frank Mccourt is PBL school a project based Learning school which is  learning throughout different projects to master certain outcomes that will be assessed on different times throughout the semester. Frank Mccourt was very warm and welcoming but it also teaches us how to be more independent and it is', ""The school's environment is not your average high school. There wasn't enough college prep for students who were going to college out of the city. Since the high school didn't have a high budget, classrooms didn't have enough material for the students to use and  students would have to pay additional to go on trips."", 'Overall, my experience as a student at Frank McCourt has been good. Although we are not offered a variety of classes in subjects like language, math, ELA, and history, at the start of your high school year, it\'s a great way to get freshman initiated in their high school experience. Since it can be very difficult to choose classes for yourself. As you progress to become a junior, and eventually a senior, you will begin to see a spectrum of classes before your eyes. They have classes from programming, cancer studies, and even the study of the butterfly effect, which is a math credit. They also have this month dedicated as ""inter-session"", where students take one rigorous class a day, based on their interest of study. Some of these classes include; ""The Study of Cuteness"", ""Lotions and Potions"", and even ""Heroes and Myths""!', 'Frank McCourt High School is a school in which the teachers push you to work at a college level and prepare you not only for college, but for life itself. The classes can be challenging but the teachers will break it down so that everyone is on the same page. The students need to work on their spirit and enthusiasm to learn but other than that it is a great school.', 'Frank McCourt is an okay school, if I am honest. The classes are very rigorous however once you get into upper house the classes become like college courses.  The teachers are friendly and very attentive towards their students whenever you need help they are always there.', ""I liked the courses that they offered.  They had something to fit everyone's personality.  It is a very small & close knit school.  I would like to see more staff in the next year or so."", ""It's an average school. The teachers are nice and seem to care a great deal, however, the academics could be fixed. For example, there could be AP and Honors courses. That would be a great way to let students who actually care be able to thrive."", 'My 4 years here was an okay experience, not the best. Since it was a new school we did not have many resources. Every school year was different because they were trying to figure out the best method of teaching and the faculty was always changing. Bottom line is, they were inconsistent. I did appreciate their attempts to get the students ""college ready,"" but in my opinion I was not college ready at all. The faculty however were extremely welcoming and family-like. Everyone knew each other and the principal even memorized every student\'s name. They took their time to get to know us and were very accommodating whenever someone needed more help. The guidance counselors always went above and beyond in finding job, volunteer, and internship opportunities for students. Overall, this school taught me the true meaning of a community, but the ambiguity of what the next school year would be like is what I did not like about this school.', ""Overall, I've had an alright experience at Frank McCourt HS.  The key to a great school is the teachers that run the classes and at FMHS, the quality is very mixed.  I've had great experiences in  some classes and terrible experiences in others."", 'I had a wonderful time at this school, I had a very happy sad relationship in my final days last year. I had some of the most supportive teachers I have ever met and made great bonds that will last a lifetime. Frank McCourt taught me so many life skills. I feel that I was prepared very well for college. I loved the PGC program that the school offered, It was very nice to be able to work with the new students and give them tips and tricks for high school.', 'Frank McCourt has always had a diverse community for as long as I have been there. Myself and other students get as much support and help we need rather academically or personally.', ""I liked the challenges I faced within the school, it wasn't to hard but it wasn't easy either you had to work for that grade. What I would change is add more activities, they made it seem like it was easy to create a club but when I tried to do it from freshman year they finally finalized it senior year when I left even though it was approved freshman year. Also they need better organization skills the school was a mess."", ""I really love this school, the curriculum is very rigorous and demanding, but, overall I think that this helped me become a better student. I've learned a lot in the three years I have been going to this school and the teacher really make you feel that you can succeed through hard work and consistency. Along with that, the students are really nice and the community in each grade is very friendly within themselves. I can definitely say that I will miss this school once I graduate, but, I will also be very grateful for the life long lesson I will be taking with me as well."", ""FMHS offers you all the opportunities for you to be an excellent reader and writer but also a better student and human being. I feel the school prepares us for college in a moderate way, but I personally wish we had AP classes, but we can take College Now courses which are more challenging and like-university-classes which I really prefer. The teachers are always there to help you be and get better and I haven't  seen any type of violence or danger in the school, because the security is really coordinated and active. Also, Frank McCourt is not only a simple school but an actual community,  because, since we are such a small school, somehow it mixes us (whether during a potlock where we meet with other advisories of other grades or during Spirit Wekk) so we can meet other people, and this is way all students know each other inside the school. I do really like the school because it treats you like a young adult human being and always try to make us be the best we can be."", ""One thing I liked is the academics & the diversity of the school. You meet a lot of different people & that is a plus for a high school. One thing I don't like about the school is that they offer no AP classes, which bothered me.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""I just graduated from FMHS in June and I have to say it was bittersweet.

I have been on the AP track and I enjoyed each class and the teacher that I was given.', 'Hackensack High School is a public high school that contains all the proper attributes to be considered mediocre. The classes do not always prioritize learning, but instead prioritize efficiency in completion of a task. The teachers vary from caring, eager to teach adults to lazy, questionable teachers who are a little too close with the girls. The clubs and activities are poorly maintained and often meet less than once a month. School culture is all but absent unless the students is directly involved in a sport. Hackensack has surprisingly abundant resources. For example, there is a room equipped with Canon cameras and iMacs, but the teacher is unprofessional and unapproachable. The theme of bad teachers and good resources is commonplace. The school is incredibly diverse, taking in students from 4 towns. HHS disregards college readiness until Senior year. Most of the qualities of the school are far below average.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I would like a cleaner and more comfortable environment.

Very small school so the students get to know there teachers one on one if they want, along with knowing each other very well. Counselor wants to know and is interested in what you would want to study very early in high school and will take you (if the student would like) to many college trips to help them get a better understanding.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I like about Talent Unlimited High School is the memories being made among friendships and community between one a another.

However the people there can be really harsh and only certain majors are close with each other and share a great environment', 'The community as a whole was pleasant. For the most part everyone is respectful and helpful. I wished that there was more consequences for students and that there was more opportunities for performing in school. The mission was that students maintain a balance between arts and academics but as of late, students are uninspired to continue their major. The new administration is doing their best to accommodate those who choose to drop their talent, but there needs to be more electives and more options for those who want to change their major or drop it.', ""What I liked most about Talent Unlimited High School is its very intensive arts program.

Middlesex High School,"['Middlesex High School has been a home for me. The teachers, guidance counselor, and principal have been very supportive and encouraging from the start.

Playing three varsity sports, running in Cross Country, to shooting hoops with the Lady Jays, to even trying out something new- throwing discus! Every volunteer event I have done has been through the school, creating memories and relationships that have changed who I am as a person for the better. Offering a variety of clubs, I was able to participate in Key Club, Environmental Club and Math League. MHS has been an exceptional journey, looking back to my freshman year, frightened of the “powerful” seniors, it seemed as if I’d never be similar to them, yet here we are. I hope to see in the future, the school to be diverse and give equal opportunities to all students.', 'Middlesex High School is okay at best. There have been some questionable hiring decisions when it comes to teachers, but there are some definite upsides. The music department is fantastic and the custodial staff does great work.', 'Honestly I like the school but overall I feel like there is a lack of rush. In bigger districts you might be pushed to do your best due to just the scarcity of chances with the sheer amount of students.

There were opportunities for everyone, from honors students, to those who needed a little extra help.

This was reflected through the tons of events we had (including a Winter-White-Out dance that I organized through the Key Club, from which all proceeds were donated to local causes!) The electives were very useful, fun, and educational. We had some that many other schools didn't, including woodshop, home ec, cooking, ceramics, etc. There were tons of opportunities to do things that you loved through our clubs, and we even had the opportunity to create new clubs if we felt strongly enough about it! MHS gave me an amazing four years, which I will remember forever."", 'It was a pretty average high school experience.

They give you all the keys to success and leave it up to you to move forward with them, and they also help you outside the classroom. You can always sit and have a chat with any teacher and they will help when no one else will listen. If i could change anything in Middlesex High school it would be the safety of the school.

The teachers, guidance counselor, and principal have been very supportive and encouraging from the start. I’m grateful that I have been able to take rigorous courses that are offered and encouraged. Not only has education been a major part, but extracurriculars as well. Playing three varsity sports, running in Cross Country, to shooting hoops with the Lady Jays, to even trying out something new- throwing discus! Every volunteer event I have done has been through the school, creating memories and relationships that have changed who I am as a person for the better. Offering a variety of clubs, I was able to participate in Key Club, Environmental Club and Math League. MHS has been an exceptional journey, looking back to my freshman year, frightened of the “powerful” seniors, it seemed as if I’d never be similar to them, yet here we are. I hope to see in the future, the school to be diverse and give equal opportunities to all students.', 'Middlesex High School is okay at best. There have been some questionable hiring decisions when it comes to teachers, but there are some definite upsides. The music department is fantastic and the custodial staff does great work.', 'Honestly I like the school but overall I feel like there is a lack of rush. In bigger districts you might be pushed to do your best due to just the scarcity of chances with the sheer amount of students. Here it feels like everything is simply aid back which helps with student stress but at the same time aids in creating unhealthy habits like procrastination', ""Middlesex High School was amazing to me. My teachers were amazing, inspiring, and genuinely cared about their students. The level of education I received was fantastic. There were opportunities for everyone, from honors students, to those who needed a little extra help. This school was a community of people who genuinely wanted to help each other grow as great as they could. This was reflected through the tons of events we had (including a Winter-White-Out dance that I organized through the Key Club, from which all proceeds were donated to local causes!) The electives were very useful, fun, and educational. We had some that many other schools didn't, including woodshop, home ec, cooking, ceramics, etc. There were tons of opportunities to do things that you loved through our clubs, and we even had the opportunity to create new clubs if we felt strongly enough about it! MHS gave me an amazing four years, which I will remember forever."", 'It was a pretty average high school experience. It definitely lacked in academics in comparison with other schools who are better funded, but overall it was okay.  The opportunity to do well academically is there, but I see how it could be easy to fall behind and not be prepared for college. The community and culture is very good and involved though.', 'I like the family atmosphere. It is a small school in a small town so everybody know everybody. Everyone supports eachother and the things that go on in the town and the school.', 'Middlesex High School is somewhere that you can call home. Even though it is a small school you know everyone so it makes the school year so much easier.', 'Middlesex High was overall a good experience, it had its ups and downs. I personally wish there was more diversity and opportunities for people of color and Latinos. I wish they prepared the junior and senior class better for college and understanding finances and money better. I wish some of the teachers were more personal and involved, and showed they genuinely cared, there were some that did that were great.', 'Going to school in a small town is great because it is easy to get everyone involved in activities. Sporting events are super exciting because we have small town pride. However, the size of our school does have its drawbacks. We have very limited classes and activities offered at our school. But the school was proficient.', 'I liked the people and staff at Middlesex High School. They were always so kind to me and others around me. They would help me with anything I needed.', 'Since Middlesex Borough is a small community, the school atmosphere is similar to a family. We all share a loving concern for each and the teachers provide insightful knowledge which improves a person day by day. In regards to our sports teams, the students have always supported each and every sport. This morale provided assistance for our football team won the Group 1 State Championship.', 'Small school in a small town, generally good school with good, kind, and helpful teachers but could do with general renovations, upgrades, etc.', 'I honestly would have nothing change about my high school. It is truly amazing for the little town that Middlesex is. I am proud to be a blue jay, with our great athletic teams as well as academics. The teachers at my school are honestly so devoted to helping us students and have thoroughly prepared me for college.', ""Middlesex High School is very spirited; students regularly wear MHS apparel and can be seen cheering for their sports teams. Because of the low student-to-teacher ratio, students and teachers can form strong bonds. However, the guidance department can be questionable and preparing seniors for college applications is not one of the school's strong points. Students are not prepared to start their applications until the beginning of their senior year, which does not provide an ample amount of time."", ""In Middlesex High School you learn what it is to be a family with others you take classes with. MHS is very diverse and every week we have fundraisers and events that make us a family. I love my high school and I wouldn't change nothing."", 'When I went to Middlesex High School, I found it to be an enriching experience. It gave me outlets for creativity and study that allowed be to pursue further knowledge at college.', ""Overall I like everything about Middlesex High School, I'm a senior in that high school and getting my education there been great."", 'It is an average school through and through. The academics and college readiness are adequate. Many of the teachers are mediocre at best, but some are downright jokes. There are many good athletic opportunities, however. There is a large amount of clubs.', 'The environment was nice, has a lot of school spirit. The teachers are very caring and want to see you succeed. They will help you in any way they can. Some updates may be needed in some classrooms and throughout the school since it is quite old.', ""I liked the small knit community of Middlesex High school, where you graduate with less than  150 students in you're class. Teachers are very good and get you to focus on what is important in the class. They give you all the keys to success and leave it up to you to move forward with them, and they also help you outside the classroom. You can always sit and have a chat with any teacher and they will help when no one else will listen. If i could change anything in Middlesex High school it would be the safety of the school. Middlesex is overall a safe town but the school itself has minimal safety. The doors are left open during the morning anyone could just walk in, you aren't required to wear or present your ID badges at all  and there are no security checks either.

The guidance office, while spread thin across the massive school is extremely caring and will give you the time if you seek help. The teachers aren't there for the money (obviously), and I've had very few experiences with bad teachers. However, I had countless experiences with genuine and impactful teachers. I had a teacher who had a month of after school review, from 1:30 to 5:00pm, in order to get students geared up and ready for our AP test. He didn't get paid for that or even asked to do it. He did it because he wants to see us succeed. A great experience that I'll never forget and be forever grateful for."", ""William floyd high school is a great school.

Some students are great, but too many cause problems.  Drugs a re the biggest problem, but admin won't even try to stop it - NEVER had drug sniffing dogs in the building at all.

I formed a lot of special connections with people that I'm still friends with. The teachers were devoted to helping their students."", 'Frankling High school was average for me. What I really enjoyed were the sports. This school definately takes their sports seriously and has a lot of school spirit. The academics are average and the food isnt great. The teachers are hit or miss, you can either have a really great teacher or a really bad one.', ""What I like about Franklin High School is the diversity of students and faculties. This school proves that it doesn't matter where you come from, you have to work hard and thrive for success. If a student is struggling academically, there are teachers willing to take the time to assist us. All students including myself take opportunities that will be important for my academic. What I like to change from this school is the safety procedures. There has been many conflicts involving threats. I believe it's best for the school to if we would evacuate the building more than a mile away instead of heading towards the stadium which is close to the school."", 'My school is a very interesting school we have many extra activities and many sports that people might want to try we have a good soccer team a good track team in which i am a part of and we have a very good basketball team that currently has an undefeated record we had one the state championships a few years ago. However our school is very different when it comes to responsibility we have many fights at our school that can be easily prevented', 'I really liked attending Franklin High School. I learned a lot of positive and educational topics from my teachers and friends. I learned how to be successful, how to be a good team member, and how to work hard in positive ways. I am very grateful for all the lessons that people taught me as well as their kind support. They have helped made me currently successful.', 'Franklin High School is such a great place. Everyone gets along with each other. There is almost never a fight in our school and even if there is it can be resolved before it gets out of hand.', ""To be honest, I love this school. I've been in Franklin Township for about 3 years now. It's a very diverse school and the academic level is a little slow. Safety is definitely an issue. Wednesday we had a bomb threat and had to evacuate the school from 1:20-3:00. Standing outside in the cold waiting for them to let us go to the buses. Then last Friday we had a gun threat and had a 90 minute shelter in place. They checked bags and lockers and jackets. I love my friends and I love the teachers, but now my Mom is looking for a different school because of safety. Tips to surviving FHS: Always have your phone on you, Don't trust security guards and substitutes because a lot of them have tried to touch girls and will look at you perverted, Report a guard or a teacher if they make you feel uncomfortable, Get to know your teachers, be nice to them, they affect your grade, etc"", 'The teachers are great but there is no organization or order within the school. There needs to be more opportunities for students.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['It was very diverse.

When I worked with the literary magazine, the lack of money prevented us from doing a lot, such as printing hard, professional copies of our work. Many students in that school were/are creative and it’s important to provide spaces where they can express their creativity. The art departments need renovation.

I was never afraid of doing bad in a class. I also believe that more art focused clubs should be added. More clubs would strengthen the community in the school, however, money was always an issue. When I worked with the literary magazine, the lack of money prevented us from doing a lot, such as printing hard, professional copies of our work. Many students in that school were/are creative and it’s important to provide spaces where they can express their creativity. The art departments need renovation. I think the school needed to focus more there. Besides these issues, the school and it’s community has helped me be a more driven and empathetic person. I’m sure they will continue to be a good school.', 'I have been in the Renaissance Charter School since Kindergarten, and if I could relive my academic experience, I would do the exact same thing. The school is very small, so the facilities are the best you can get with a space like that. The teachers are wonderful and easy to talk to. You can form a connection with every teacher you meet really easily. The school is great, I would recommend it.', ""I was a student from 4th grade until I graduated high school. I loved the atmosphere, the teachers and faculty were extremely involved with the students and knew the students on a personal level. I enjoyed my time at TRCS although I do think they could've created more of a boundary with the students. I believe the student-teacher relationship was more of a friendship which often caused students to lose respect of their teachers."", 'This school is very different from other public schools I have been to. The reason for that being is because of their methods of teaching. The students know their teachers and staff on a first name basis and there are no uniforms to remove an authoritative barrier set by other school. The school is small so everyone knows each other making the environment feel like a family. Then to give students additional skills they offer classes in three forms of arts. These art forms are music, art and theater. By the time graduation comes around the students should be well rounded in these talents. Overall, this small school with a family like environment sets a student up for success.', 'The renaissance charter school is a close knitted school, like a family. The attention towards the school is wonderful. has an amazing college bound office and amazing opportunity. The only thing i would change is the amount of funding that they receive because there are a lot of things that could be changed about the building.', 'What I like about this school, is that it is very small and it is very easy to make friends, it is a very social environment. Backed up behind very supportive teachers that care about what you plan on doing with yourself. This school also has a pretty good range of activities and clubs to keep yourself busy after school.', 'The Renaissance Charter school is a very small school with a very close nit community. This is one of the Renaissance Charter Schools Strengths. In the Renaissance, teachers and students don\'t have just a ""Know the teachers name and do the persons work"" relation ship. Because of the small teacher to student ratio, teachers and students become friends and have a close relationship with one another. Teachers are always available to stay after school to review work and know each student as a person, not a number. This relationship helps students strive to become a better person by learning directly from their teachers.', 'I enjoyed the personal connections that I had with my teachers all throughout middle school and high school. The school is really small which allows for more opportunities to get help from teachers. I also enjoy that there is a homework center where students can get help from teachers during specific hours. This has helped students improve academically. I would not like to see any change because I believe the school is good as it is.', 'I like that the Renaissance Charter School is a very diverse school and that teachers have a close relationship with their students, the school also provides after school resources if students need it. As for a change I would like there to be more clubs and activities offered in the school.', 'It is very much like a community and the teachers really look out for you! It is, however, biased to extents on its punishments. Even so, the school itself is massively close knitted and happy.', ""I'm currently a junior at the school, and I've had quite a pleasant experience at the school. Being there since kindergarten allowed me to create lifelong bonds with people there. The school is super diverse; Lord knows how many nations are represented in the school!We have a private food company, which increases the quality of the food. I feel challenged in school, which is a good thing.Its small size and status as a charter school doesn't allow for many resources to be allocated, but we make do with what we have.I've really enjoyed my experience here.Especially Rensizzle Week. You NEED to experience that for yourself."", 'The school holds a diverse community and strong academics to keep students focused. The activities are encouraging for students and allow them to be ambitious. The safe community excepts everyone and lets them feel welcomed and happy.', ""When I first came to the school, the teachers, staff, and my classmates were all welcoming and kind. The teachers and staff are open to questions and don't might talking to you after class. The adults here are always trying to help the students in every way possible through study centers, student support, and other mechanisms. However, the school can sometimes be unorganized, such as schedule issues on the first day of school. In terms of college readiness, the college guidance counselor and the college bound teacher are almost always available and they work so hard during and after school, even on breaks, to make sure that all of us seniors are ready for college and have all our college and financial aid applications ready.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Overall the school has a great  philosophy, attempting to combine community, family and education all together under one roof.

The school also lacks quite a bit of funding (at least the high school) and in the variety of programs and clubs for kids to participate in. The only exception is their dramatic arts program which is truly some of the school's strong points. The school instead tries to get kids to participate in other programs or in internships. The school also lacks a variety in AP classes and academic wise, their English department is great.

The majority of the students do not take their studies seriously and even the top tier of students in each class lack the effort to make it far. Therefore, the teachers are more concerned with trying to get students to pass rather than excel. There a handful of great teachers such in various departments who actually try to help their students do better than mediocre and those were the ones who helped me get somewhere. I currently go to Binghamton University but the majority of my classmates went to community college. I hated the authority here - the administration treated us like insolent children and kept us on a tight leash. You want to go to the bathroom?

This allows for a close knit community where the students aren't only supported by the entire staff, but also pushed to be the very best they can be. Copiague has long had a reputation of low test scores and an unsafe environment. After being in The Copiague School District for a total of 7 years, I can say with absolute certainty that this is no longer true.

The diversity in the population also broadened students perspectives, educating them about different cultures and ideas. There is  a general aura of respect that comes with the name Sewanhaka, and many of the staff there actually graduated and came back to give back to the community; sharing much of this school's abundant opportunities.

There are a few good ones that actually care if their students pass or not. Guidance counselors stop trying around eleventh grade. It's always dirty, a lot of bugs and mice.

I love how kind and welcoming most of the kids and faculty members are,and the zero tolerance policy they enforce when it comes to bullying. Everyone tries to make you feel comfortable and fit in. Additionally, I think it is amazing that eventually you'll always find your place in this school. They have a various amount of clubs and sports that people can join and may even find people who can end up being your best friend. What is really and truly astonishing is that many of these teachers try and push you to be the best that you can be."", 'Sewanhaka High School gave me the chance to have a close network with my teachers, friends, janitors, AP, Principal, & Security Guards. I love it.', 'Sewanhaka High school was very diverse which I liked. The assistant principal is Guyanese and it was nice becasue most of the kids who went there were also from Guyana and there was a lot of diversity. The teachers were friendly, most of them. However, some of them were quite racist and there was a case on them. The alumni of the school including me had all come together and spoke out against what was happening. We took a stand against the racism and two of the teachers who were racist were actually fired. It took just one person and we all came together to use our voices. Our voices made a change and it was comforting to know that we had power collectively.', 'The school is great in terms of optimistic spirits, the teachers are willing to help everyone.

My reason for giving Bloomfield High School three stars is because not every school is perfect, however, this high school gives back to its students and community as if their life depends on it and does not give up."", ""Bloomfield High School is a diverse school. It is made up of students of different cultural backgrounds. The teachers are very helpful when you need assistance. The academic level is very good and it helps you prepare for college readiness. Everyday, there is always a different challenge to accomplish and the teacher show respect and that is a great way to show leadership in aspects of love and kindness. Bloomfield is known to many people and being a Bloomfield Bengal is an honor and always tells a person that lives in the community that we Bloomfield Bengals strive for greatness. I want to Thank God for this 4 year experience which had a lot of obstacles and with the help of God's wisdom and guidance I want to finish strong with a stronger finish to help me prepare for the next chapter in my life."", ""This school made me feel like I was able to do all things I put my mind to.

I've taken AP classes, been involved in sports, the arts, and numerous community service projects through the school.

The resources available to me have been endless and I have had no complaints.

Some others do not really use methods to make students involved with the subject. Counselors and directive personnel are not really present with everyone in the school. ESL students might seem marginalized in the school not only by students but also by staff (personal experience). Regardless, there are many others who truly care about the students and make the most of their classes to not only teach about their subject, but also to teach students important lessons about life in general. Overall, the school could try to emphasize getting more involved with students and create a stronger community', 'This school is extremely diverse; whether it’s by race, gender, sexual orientation Bloomfield high school makes you feel welcome. The mix of all the schools coming togetwhe and you still manage to find your people. Unlike other schools Bloomfield High has a sprinkle of every kind of person.

In fact, Bloomfield has after-school tutoring and Wednesday schedules to encourage you to seek help. Bloomfield Highschool has fun events and lots of activities you can take part in. I highly suggest you consider Bloomfield High school; "" It is a great day to be a Bengal.""', 'Like any school, there are good and bad teachers, but the few outstanding teachers are pretty much only found in the upperclassmen AP courses. It is entirely possible to succeed academically, and a decent amount of AP classes and similar resources are available to those who look for them, but it is basically left up to the student and their family to succeed in school and prepare for college. The general student body is not concerned with school and a large minority are overtly apathetic, if not defiant. The public statistics on disciplinary infractions and drop-out rates are far from accurate. One of the few redeeming qualities is the excellent diversity, both racial and socioeconomic, which I have not encountered anywhere else. While I had many good experiences, close friends, and supportive teachers, I would not have made it into a selective university without the support of my family and outside academic programs.', ""Bloomfield High is an amazing school that prepares you for more than just college but life in general. Though I do feel as though administration should be more heavy handed with things like bullying and drug use. Overall it's an amazing school."", ""There are many opportunities due to the large enrollment. It is very diverse. The principal is very friendly. Teachers are always willing to help. The guidance counselors are very helpful and want us to be prepared for college. The school is kept clean. There are many different events going on, so there's always something to do.

She was given her students Imentor, a program where each student in every grade has a mentor throughout the 4 years and after. She, also, has open the door for us students to travel abroad for a week of an international poetry exchange program.

What I wish to see changed in this school is administration considering what students have to say in terms of problems with teachers.

The teachers are good, at least they were when I went there, I think a good amount of them have left now. The principal is sweet and she cares about her students. It was rarely extremely dirty and usually decently kept. Student work is a pride here, so expect to see a lot of student art and to have performances if you're in Dance or orchestra. There could've been more clubs, and more sports besides only track and soccer. Also more diversity, 99% of anyone there is Spanish. Which is cool, if you're Spanish.

Young Womens Leadership School,"[""The Young Women's Leadership School of Astoria provides its students with many helpful resources, along with a variety of different extracurricular activities. There are always many things to look forward to when learning. During middle school, I was a very shy person. However, continuing my education in this school helped me grow as more outgoing person. The teachers in this school are always caring and make sure you have the availability to whatever it is you need. Their optimistic feelings towards their students really help encourage them to work hard and try to achieve their goals. Because every teacher has a unique style of teaching their students, it is very easy to understand the new materials that is being taught in the classroom. It is really easy to make new connections and friends. The school in general, is a very safe and enjoyable environment to be in. This school has taught me many things and is something I will never forget."", 'First off, this school has grown to be very diverse as it values the importance of every culture, which encourages students to take pride in their culture. This school does its best to prepare you for college, making you more aware of the rigorous college process even if you are a middle schooler. Most teachers have been understanding and helpful whenever I need guidance or reassurance when I am struggling in my academics or even in my personal life. However, there is a very small handful of teachers who need to be a bit understanding and be more professional when speaking to a student. My concern with this school is that admin seems to care more about maintaining a good reputation without being quick to hear and help resolve the issues students are currently facing on the daily whether it is with a teacher or a student.', 'I enjoyed my time at The Young Women\'s Leadership School of Astoria. I was a student here since 6th grade, and they place a heavy value on community and sisterhood. I created friendships I will never forget, and since day one have been preparing for college. I only wish administration was more understanding to students\' situations instead of having a ""one solution fits all"" approach. They need to start listening to the students\' wants and needs, as opposed to remaining, worried about their reputation. However, I do love the Young Women\'s Leadership School of Astoria\'s technology passion. Every student get her own laptop and we have multiple coding classes.', 'I have been in this school since 6th grade and I have gone through multiple changes in administration. But I will say that despite that the school has stayed close to its traditions and roots. They focus on empowering young women to become the leaders of tomorrow. They offer many opportunities in STEAM fields and they are very proud of how much diversity they have. Not to mention that the teachers are so caring and lovely to work with. They all genuinely care about the students and will do their best to help us in any way. Sure you might get sick of it after the 4th year but I have heard from multiple students who had transferred out of here that there is no place like this school.', ""The Young Women's Leadership School of Astoria is a very diverse school. You meet people from so many different walks of life. The teachers are very nice and helpful. They are always helping out students with academics and personal life, and they only just want the best for you."", 'Very loving and comfortable!! Helps young women to feel powerful! Teaches young women that men aren’t the only ones who can be successful. Empowers women to do great things in the community!', 'I love the fact that TYWLS pushes women to be excellent. They allow us to think and learn to the best of our abilities. TYWLS helps you grow as a person. However, the people in the school are the issue. The administration and faculty often have issues with students. The students as well are hard to deal with. Overall, the TYWLS experience is something to remember. Even though its hard it prepares you for the real world.', 'I have been studying in this school for one and a half year. The teachers are very nice and patient with students. There are some clubs open for student, such as table tennis, softball, volleyball, softball, Asian culture club and so on. I hope there are more clubs can open for students. However, this school does not provide a lot of AP courses, especially lack of science AP courses. Students have no chance to take science AP courses in high school.', 'Allows readiness for College College Networking is very important here Able to meet a multitude of high-achieving and successful women', 'I have been in the Young Women\'s Leadership School of Astoria for over seven years. I would like to say that the Middle School is much better and I would definitely recommend as it laid an essential foundation for these ""awkward"" three years that many students struggle in finding themselves. In contrast, the high school should entirely be steered away. The school is also guilty for clear favoritism: the few opportunities the school provides is always the same small percentage of students while the other students are left to struggle. This school portrays themselves to be ""good"" on the outside, but underneath the school has evident issues that affect the students that the school tries to cover up. Some include that teachers have clear bias towards students that they have common personal interests with(such as music) and the school has one of the lowest averages SAT scores. Also, over 15 teachers over the past 3 years have left.', ""There are so many resources available here. Everyone is here to help YOU and help make your future a success. No matter what you're going through you can find a faculty member at this school to help you through it."", ""The Young Women's Leadership school is such a diverse and student involved school. It really helped me be prepared academically and emotionally. They could however make some things a bit challenging to stimulate what we might face academically in the future."", ""Classes aren't very challenging - there really is no need to think. It is very easy to plass the class. \r There isn't a variety of classes. It has the core classes, and maybe one art class and one music class. That's it. \r It is also very difficult to speak to someone about your schedule. If you want to sit down and chat about what classes would be best for you to take, or if you just want to transfer out of a class because you already took it last semester - the person who does this is often out of reach, and when you find her, she is closed off, blunt and abrupt, rude, and off-putting. She is unlikable, and likes to complain about how much work she has to do, and that we shouldn't complain so much. \r The teachers like to pretend they don't know about any problems you may have, and they see themselves as higher beings. They preach openness and invite you to go to them if you need something, but if you take them up on their offer, the clam up, and are not helpful, in the academic or personal sense."", ""We have a security guard at the front entrance of the school - she is generally rude, unlikable, with an all-around mean disposition. She has been effective at stopping fights that break out amongst students.\r Bullying has been pretty bad at school, cyber-bullying prevalent. Not much has been done in this retrospect. \r The school nurse is absent most of the time, and is generally difficult to reach. She is also unresponsive - if she is on break and you need her help, you have to wait until she is no longer on break. \r We have had the sex talk, and there are posters around the school detailing where you can get condoms from, but that's about it in the intercourse department."", ""The school does not have enough funds to maintain a variety of after school or extracurricular activities or clubs. There used to be violin choir, art club, mouse squad, student government, yoga, MSA, book clubs, extra help (tutoring), etc. But they were all shut down and taken out. Administration isn't really supportive either. The head of administration has been changing for the last few years, and with every change, the school's condition becomes worse. \r However, luckily thatnks to our P.E teacher, our school has maintained sports teams.

There are always many things to look forward to when learning. During middle school, I was a very shy person. However, continuing my education in this school helped me grow as more outgoing person. The teachers in this school are always caring and make sure you have the availability to whatever it is you need. Their optimistic feelings towards their students really help encourage them to work hard and try to achieve their goals. Because every teacher has a unique style of teaching their students, it is very easy to understand the new materials that is being taught in the classroom. It is really easy to make new connections and friends. The school in general, is a very safe and enjoyable environment to be in. This school has taught me many things and is something I will never forget."", 'First off, this school has grown to be very diverse as it values the importance of every culture, which encourages students to take pride in their culture. This school does its best to prepare you for college, making you more aware of the rigorous college process even if you are a middle schooler. Most teachers have been understanding and helpful whenever I need guidance or reassurance when I am struggling in my academics or even in my personal life. However, there is a very small handful of teachers who need to be a bit understanding and be more professional when speaking to a student. My concern with this school is that admin seems to care more about maintaining a good reputation without being quick to hear and help resolve the issues students are currently facing on the daily whether it is with a teacher or a student.', 'I enjoyed my time at The Young Women\'s Leadership School of Astoria. I was a student here since 6th grade, and they place a heavy value on community and sisterhood. I created friendships I will never forget, and since day one have been preparing for college. I only wish administration was more understanding to students\' situations instead of having a ""one solution fits all"" approach. They need to start listening to the students\' wants and needs, as opposed to remaining, worried about their reputation. However, I do love the Young Women\'s Leadership School of Astoria\'s technology passion. Every student get her own laptop and we have multiple coding classes.', 'I have been in this school since 6th grade and I have gone through multiple changes in administration. But I will say that despite that the school has stayed close to its traditions and roots. They focus on empowering young women to become the leaders of tomorrow. They offer many opportunities in STEAM fields and they are very proud of how much diversity they have. Not to mention that the teachers are so caring and lovely to work with. They all genuinely care about the students and will do their best to help us in any way. Sure you might get sick of it after the 4th year but I have heard from multiple students who had transferred out of here that there is no place like this school.', ""The Young Women's Leadership School of Astoria is a very diverse school. You meet people from so many different walks of life. The teachers are very nice and helpful. They are always helping out students with academics and personal life, and they only just want the best for you."", 'Very loving and comfortable!! Helps young women to feel powerful! Teaches young women that men aren’t the only ones who can be successful. Empowers women to do great things in the community!', 'I love the fact that TYWLS pushes women to be excellent. They allow us to think and learn to the best of our abilities. TYWLS helps you grow as a person. However, the people in the school are the issue. The administration and faculty often have issues with students. The students as well are hard to deal with. Overall, the TYWLS experience is something to remember. Even though its hard it prepares you for the real world.', 'I have been studying in this school for one and a half year. The teachers are very nice and patient with students. There are some clubs open for student, such as table tennis, softball, volleyball, softball, Asian culture club and so on. I hope there are more clubs can open for students. However, this school does not provide a lot of AP courses, especially lack of science AP courses. Students have no chance to take science AP courses in high school.', 'Allows readiness for College College Networking is very important here Able to meet a multitude of high-achieving and successful women', 'I have been in the Young Women\'s Leadership School of Astoria for over seven years. I would like to say that the Middle School is much better and I would definitely recommend as it laid an essential foundation for these ""awkward"" three years that many students struggle in finding themselves. In contrast, the high school should entirely be steered away. The school is also guilty for clear favoritism: the few opportunities the school provides is always the same small percentage of students while the other students are left to struggle. This school portrays themselves to be ""good"" on the outside, but underneath the school has evident issues that affect the students that the school tries to cover up. Some include that teachers have clear bias towards students that they have common personal interests with(such as music) and the school has one of the lowest averages SAT scores. Also, over 15 teachers over the past 3 years have left.', ""There are so many resources available here. Everyone is here to help YOU and help make your future a success. No matter what you're going through you can find a faculty member at this school to help you through it."", ""The Young Women's Leadership school is such a diverse and student involved school.

It is very easy to plass the class. \r There isn't a variety of classes. It has the core classes, and maybe one art class and one music class. That's it. \r It is also very difficult to speak to someone about your schedule. If you want to sit down and chat about what classes would be best for you to take, or if you just want to transfer out of a class because you already took it last semester - the person who does this is often out of reach, and when you find her, she is closed off, blunt and abrupt, rude, and off-putting. She is unlikable, and likes to complain about how much work she has to do, and that we shouldn't complain so much. \r The teachers like to pretend they don't know about any problems you may have, and they see themselves as higher beings. They preach openness and invite you to go to them if you need something, but if you take them up on their offer, the clam up, and are not helpful, in the academic or personal sense."", ""We have a security guard at the front entrance of the school - she is generally rude, unlikable, with an all-around mean disposition. She has been effective at stopping fights that break out amongst students.\r Bullying has been pretty bad at school, cyber-bullying prevalent. Not much has been done in this retrospect. \r The school nurse is absent most of the time, and is generally difficult to reach. She is also unresponsive - if she is on break and you need her help, you have to wait until she is no longer on break. \r We have had the sex talk, and there are posters around the school detailing where you can get condoms from, but that's about it in the intercourse department."", ""The school does not have enough funds to maintain a variety of after school or extracurricular activities or clubs. There used to be violin choir, art club, mouse squad, student government, yoga, MSA, book clubs, extra help (tutoring), etc. But they were all shut down and taken out. Administration isn't really supportive either. The head of administration has been changing for the last few years, and with every change, the school's condition becomes worse. \r However, luckily thatnks to our P.E teacher, our school has maintained sports teams.

Most of the times students don't attend school events and you rarely see students supporting students during games, or art shows."", 'My experience at the High School of Fashion Industries has been a good one. It is a Career and Technical Education School (CTE). The school wants all their students to graduate and hopefully go to college right after. They want the school to be a safe haven when any student can come to any adult to talk with them about any problems and deal with it by having a solution', 'My daughter’s teachers are really caring.  They’re there for them when they need someone to talk to.  The principal sincerely cares about the well being of his students.  Very happy my daughter attends this school.', 'I really like that I was able to work on what I wanted to do in the future which is graphic design. It was important for me to get started in what i was planing to do in college, right now I am working 3 part time jobs to pay for my college and the training I received in school is helping me to achieve my goals', 'I had a good experience attending the High School of Fashion Industries. I learned a lot from being there within just four years. The school is very unique and tries to get everyone involved in something. The students are friendly so it is easy to make friends and teachers are very polite, so it is easy to connect with them. The principle always kept us posted on events going on and had special programs. Whenever we needed help there was always someone available. We have a college office, library, counselors office, student lounge, and so many other places to go and talk and interact. The only thing I can say about this schoolis if fashion or business is not what you want to pursuit in, then this school would not suit you because those are the majors they focus on, so once you’re there you have to stick with the specific majors that they have even if that’s not what you want plan on doing in the future.', 'The staff in this high school are amazing. The principal takes the time to hear from all students and teachers really care for the students well being.', ""The high school of fashion industries is by far the best fashion based high school in New York, there are so many perks for being a fashion major. This school is very hands on for all majors not just fashion, plus the school adds more majors a year. For any one who would like to pursue fashion as there career this high school preps you for everything, to specify the school teaches you draping, textiles, pattern making, you also learn how to create garments in different way. And if you can't sew the definitely take time to teach you how to sew on different materials, they also teach you how to create your portfolio  for college and that's for all majors too. They have tutoring for majors too. It is not a perfect school but the school will have your back to make sure you are successful when you leave the school.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

However, I think that there should be a larger variety of extra curricular other than sports. There is a large emphasis on college readiness, which is good. Students begin to take college courses in addition to their regular high school classes starting from their sophomore year. Some teachers offer outside resources to assist us with the material we are learning in class and to gain additional information and knowledge of the subject.', 'I started attending this school in ninth grade and was very nervous.

The teachers all want to see you succeed and try to help you the best they can even though there is a lack of materials.', 'This school is very rigorous and prepares you for college well.
