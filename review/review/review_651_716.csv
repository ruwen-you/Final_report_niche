Comprehensive Model School Project - M.S. 327,"[""My experience at CMSP 327 was a rather fun experience. Considering that I was apart of the first graduating classes since the high school was built. I've know the staff and my classmates for almost 10 years. We all grew up together. The teachers and other administrative staff saw me grow up, watched me make mistakes and were there to guide in the right direction. As cliche as it sounds i wouldn't be here if it weren't for the great adults  and my closest friends in Comprehensive Model School Project 327."", 'Although CMSP 327 is a strict school, they worry about their students. Teachers  and staff members make sure you are on track with your schoolwork, if not they approach you and provide tips that can better improve you if needed.', ""I am a current Senior at CMSP 327 and from my 7 years in this school I would say that it is a very good middle school/highschool. This school is a joint middle and highschool and provides it's students with most, if not all, of the resources they will need to make it through their time here. The teachers are great and are always willing to help you better understand the curriculum if you have any problems. The administration tries to make sure that the students get enough information on the college application process and deciding which college is the best for them with many college workshops. If you are searching for a very good middle/highschool CMSP is the place your looking for."", 'I liked that the school has teachers and faculty that care for the kids and that they do their best to help them succeed. They also offer advanced classes for students that are able to take them, giving them a head start.', 'Comprehensive Model School Project- M.S. 327 is an amazing school. Not only is there great diversity, but the teachers are very involved in their students welfare, leading to an incredible amount of comfort while attending.  The teachers are always available, even providing professional emails and their phone numbers in order for students to text them whenever they need help.  They have no trouble staying after hours to help students to learn whatever they may need help with and take their students education very seriously.  The school also makes sure to provide various opportunities that students may not ba able to get otherwise.  The staff will work with students to take tours of colleges that they may be interested in going to, and works to provide programs to help students figure out what they may want to study in college.  The student council, run by a select seniors, work to speak with the entire highschool in order to give students a voice.', 'I enjoyed being apart of this school because the teachers encourage you to learn and do your very best. They are also interested on you as well. They are super easy going and easy to talk to especially the principal.

The teachers are very caring and they want all the students to succeed and become successful in life. They often encourage the students to go for an advanced regents diploma and help students get into really amazing colleges. The school environment is very friendly and clean and nice. The school offers a lot of sports such as volleyball, basketball, and baseball. As a current senior in this school I strongly recommend parents who live in the Bronx area to send their child to this school.', 'The teachers and staff are very friendly, and they truly care about your education. However, the number of clubs and activities are very limited, and the college readiness program could do a lot better.', 'The school is pretty and somewhat new. Though, some of the teachers are fake and inconsiderate. The students in the school are friendly. The school is in the Bronx so it’s not diverse. Besides a few white teachers there are no more than 5 students outside my race (Black/African American). It is required that you take more regents than you need, more classes than you need, so you could say they push you.', 'CMSP is a family and is very concerned about your education. You will never feel lost or like an outlier.', 'The teachers are well equipped to teach. They make it so that teens are able to comprehend the topics that are being given. They have good teacher and student relationship. Most students have a teacher they can go up to for any advice.', 'This school is a very good school. Although they have expanded the school nearly 5 years ago, it has maintained it utmost diversity. The potential that the staff and the administration had shown towards their student is wonderful and wants to see them succeed in their best shape. The only thing that they could have changed when I went to school there is the cafeteria food and the lack of sports.', ""I attended this school before it became a high school. It was a middle school first in front of Crotona park and then turned into a high school and middle school combined now located in Jerome. I grew up with everyone and the staff became like my family. They guided me through the whole college process and helped me reach my greatest potential. This school has one of the best educators in the Bronx and its mainly because they care and put effort that other schools don't to make sure their students meet the expectations and go above and beyond what they can achieve. The only thing I would change about this school is add more extra curricular activities to keep the students interested and entertained and make them well rounded students that have an academic and social life as well."", 'I like how they focus a lot on our academics and how everyone gets along with each other.

One can see students participating in classes such as Materials and Designs, Dramatic Arts, Choir and Band, Accounting,  TV Production, and Drone Flight among many others.

I wouldn't like to see anything change."", 'My experience at kearny high school was good overall. I made many friends and participated in some activities. I did well in my classes and got high grades in most of my courses. One thing I would like to change though is the mindset of the faculty at kearny high because it feels as if they are always against you in most situations. Other than that, this high school taught me many things not only about core subjects but about life as well and I wont forget about my time in this school.', 'This school has many clubs and sports to offer students and it is very diverse. Most teachers care about their students and want them to succeed. They offer morning and afternoon help to anyone who needs it and are flexible with schedules.', ""Kearny High School is what you make of it. It can be a good school for a lot of people, or it could be an average experience for others. In no way do we have the best academics or facilities, but we do have resources many schools do not have like our Dental, Medical, Cooking, and Auto trade classes.  If you are a good student and take your academics seriously, then the school is not that bad and can actually be a great resource. However that being said, we do have other problems. The drug culture is huge here, and smoking weed is as common as brushing your teeth in the morning. The hallways always smell, and you have many classmates strung out. Other drugs are common too, but as long as you don't roll with that crowd it won't be as obvious. Fights break out daily, and disrespectful students flood the school. My recommendation is don't try to fit in. Do what YOU enjoy whether it be being a part of our amazing athletics (which by the way we are insanely good), or academics."", ""From freshman year of high school to senior year, Kearny High School has changed drastically. Our school has had an extreme makeover and it looks beautiful now. We have a variety of electives and sports to choose from.

However, they should have more college readiness classes.', 'Khs is a fairly average school.  There are many opportunities here and the teachers are very involved with students for the most part.

I am involved in a class called Teen PEP, which teaches about sex, drugs, etc. to underclassmen. I like that class because I feel like it is preparing me to teach in the future.

The sports in the district was pretty good especially the soccer team, the soccer team is incredible in my area.

The construction had taken place over the last 10 or so years and was due to stop around my sophomore year but it did not stop there. The education at Kearny High is decent, and the teachers are genuinely good people dedicated to teaching their students, but the constant drilling noises and continuous smells of dust and debris affected each student. Other than that aspect, the school provides many wonderful opportunities for the students and allows us to express ourselves in several different and unique ways.', ""It was an interesting experience that had taught me a lot. I was able to be exposed to many different types of classes, from the school's dental class to the many art programs they have."", 'A lot of school spirit, and sports involvement. Offers different clubs and is diverse with lots of different  cultures.', ""I loved Kearny High. It's a small town high school filled with childhood friends. Their soccer team is excellent, they really take pride in their athletics programs. As the years go on I see more and more changes with the school."", ""I  like the academic opportunities offered at Kearny High. I like the variety of programs and electives available to students. I wouldn't like to see anything change."", 'My experience at kearny high school was good overall. I made many friends and participated in some activities. I did well in my classes and got high grades in most of my courses. One thing I would like to change though is the mindset of the faculty at kearny high because it feels as if they are always against you in most situations. Other than that, this high school taught me many things not only about core subjects but about life as well and I wont forget about my time in this school.', 'This school has many clubs and sports to offer students and it is very diverse. Most teachers care about their students and want them to succeed. They offer morning and afternoon help to anyone who needs it and are flexible with schedules.', ""Kearny High School is what you make of it. It can be a good school for a lot of people, or it could be an average experience for others. In no way do we have the best academics or facilities, but we do have resources many schools do not have like our Dental, Medical, Cooking, and Auto trade classes.  If you are a good student and take your academics seriously, then the school is not that bad and can actually be a great resource. However that being said, we do have other problems. The drug culture is huge here, and smoking weed is as common as brushing your teeth in the morning. The hallways always smell, and you have many classmates strung out. Other drugs are common too, but as long as you don't roll with that crowd it won't be as obvious. Fights break out daily, and disrespectful students flood the school. My recommendation is don't try to fit in. Do what YOU enjoy whether it be being a part of our amazing athletics (which by the way we are insanely good), or academics."", ""From freshman year of high school to senior year, Kearny High School has changed drastically. Our school has had an extreme makeover and it looks beautiful now. We have a variety of electives and sports to choose from. The teachers are kind and caring and some really do push their kids to do the best they could. One thing I don't like about this school is that they try to take privileges from students over small or accidental incidents. I also wish that the curriculum was more challenging."", 'They offer various classes to enable you to find what you may like to do in the future early on. There are many caring teachers as well.

I left thinking I was ready to take on the world, but once I arrived in college and spoke to my peers about the resources their schools offered them, I felt that going to Kearny High School was a disadvantage.', ""I truly enjoyed my time at KHS however, the construction prevented me and my fellow classmates from doing certain things. I have seen the school since graduation and I'm glad others are able to enjoy the construction we spent 4 years enduring."", 'The diversity and education in the school are very good and the teachers care about the students. All teachers are very dedicated to helping students because of their passion for teaching.  The facility handles emergencies very well. The students attempt to create events which will make school more enjoyable, and the school is very accepting of all genders, races, and sexes. However, they should have more college readiness classes.', 'Khs is a fairly average school.  There are many opportunities here and the teachers are very involved with students for the most part.  However, one thing I would like to see improve is student inclusivity and the opportunity to have a voice with how the school makes choices regarding the students.', ""The faculty and staff are incredible. Many teachers are passionate about their profession and it shows in their teaching manners. I don't regret attending KHS"", ""In my four years of high school, i have a pretty good life. The school was great, strict, but great. I couldn't complain, because to others we are privileged to even have proper education. All my teachers were great, I got to know my teachers, a formed a great student-teacher bond. My grades are fantastic, and I just hope i can carry on."", 'In my high school we are gaining more technology. We are also adding a lot of new classes to expand the learning. My high school has definitely gotten a lot better since my freshman year!

I am involved in a class called Teen PEP, which teaches about sex, drugs, etc. to underclassmen. I like that class because I feel like it is preparing me to teach in the future. I like how it is peers teaching peers because the students pay more attention to their friends than the teacher.', 'Wondering around the hallways you meet different type of people, some are weird and some are just typical high school kids that follow social media trends.

The sports in the district was pretty good especially the soccer team, the soccer team is incredible in my area.

Despite this, there need to be a few improvements such as the amount of college readiness that this school provides. The administration should also look towards working more closely with the students to help them with college applications and scholarship opportunities.', 'My experience at international high school was overall the best, I’ve attended this high school for 4 long but short years. And I’ve learned so much from not only the teachers in the classes but outside the classes from students, guidance counselors, even the principals. And going to that school changed my life before I attended international I was going down a path nobody wanted me to go down and then it just finally hit me and it was time for a change and international changed me and molded me to be great and now I’m a high school graduate going to college in the fall.

Some students however, regard high school as a waste of time and it shows as they walk through the school. They show no remorse in their lack of interest for the school or their education.

In the school, however, there\'s the International Baccalaureate Programme. It supplies nationally accepted qualification for entry into higher education.

Once you get into Junior year, you\'ll receive your ceremony, an IB diploma, a gold pin that says ""IB"", titled as ""IB"" student, and a fun breakfast brunch!

I am challenged everyday and learn how to think independently.', 'My experience in the 4 years of my high school career was fun . International is one of the best school in Paterson.

Everything happen with seriousness of purpose.', 'I like that it has advanced courses to prepare the students for their academics. It is my first year at International High School, and since my first day I have been amazed at the school.

It is a great school that helps students achieve academic growth to prepare them for college.', 'I mean the school is great in general, it just has lack of any activities and programs that can actually make the students want to learn.

Additionally students are easily distracted at the school they are also very talkative. I belive the students require further discipline but it is not the schools fault. Despite the students and after school programs I for sure recomend this school. If you are looking to create a remberable high school experience this  is the right school, the people are great and the school allows for many great memeories to be formed. It is easy to stand out in this school and excell in all academic areas. There are various college driven programs that are benificial to the students when applying for colleges in the long run.', ""I've been at this school since 2014 and I've met a bunch of new people, formed bonds with my fellow students & Teachers.The Building it self has four schools in one so there's plenty of people to get to know. The sports are open to all schools s that makes it more fun. Trips were fun but they were rare.The Teachers & Staff cared about you meaning they would always check up on you to see how you was doing"", ""My experience with New vision charter High school for Advanced Math and Science 3 is that teachers are involved in students academics. If a student has fallen off the path to graduate they make sure to give them the resources to get back on track along with attention that they need to be successful. The faculty is close with the students as many students have a teacher that they trust and feel comfortable with. My school gives all the students the resources that they need to graduate, go to college and in general life lessons. My school pushed students to achieve above and beyond and we are encouraged to retake regents if the regent score is not up to ability, we apply for CUNY and SUNY schools as a back-up plan if we don't get in to private and liberal arts schools."", ""The teachers are very dedicated to helping students succeed. Also, most teachers are willing to help students with personal problems. There aren't many clubs but the beauty in that is that you can make one! Also, there are classes that help students apply for college, mostly because it is a gruesome process. The teachers, courses, and staff in general are very nice and helpful. However, because entry to the school is by a lottery process, not much could be said for the student body. This is a bit of a traditional problem with most schools however. Also, since the school is still new, it is pretty small and shares a building with larger institutions."", 'My experience at New visions has been great. Everyone is wonderful and helps a lot. The teachers are very helpful and the administrations are very great to work with.', 'I really love all the support that the teachers give, they sincerely care about making you succeed. Another thing is that all the counselors make sure that they are constantly making sure you are prepared for college.', 'I like the fact that the teachers and the principal work hard to prepare kids for college and present us with options for a better future. I would like the strict school uniform code changed where kids are allowed to wear whatever shoes or sneakers they like and whatever color sweater they like.', 'I don\'t like AMS 2 one bit. They are extremely strict and have too many rules. They are also too test oriented. They focus more on students passing standardized tests than actually learning the material. We get a quizzes and tests every week in every class including useless electives. They don\'t teach us so we can be educated individuals ready for the real world, they teach us so we can pass the regents. And if you don\'t pass the regents with an 80 or above they force you to keep retaking it until you get an 80 because ""colleges like 80s"". While other schools end at 2:50 and 3:00 AMS 2 students don\'t leave until 4:30! Then are forced to go to after school help sessions and after school clubs and sports, so we don\'t leave until it\'s pitch black night outside. They claim to love their students but their actions don\'t show it. We have no freedom or voice in anything.', 'I like Niche because It gives me a wide variety of scholarships I can choose from but I hate that we have to keep signing up for different scholarships.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,

In comparison to most other high schools, CCAA is a very small school, which creates strong bonds between students themselves and staff. What stands out the most of CCAA is the Early College program. Students who are able to pass all their classes are allowed to take college classes at The City College of New York and gain college credits. This means that by 12th grade most students are no longer attending the CCAA building but spend their days enrolled in regular college classes amongst other college students at the City College campus. One downside of this high school is that it does not get much funding to provide students with much outside of school activities or experiences. College courses also tend to be very challenging which is something that students may struggle with.', 'The school has a good environment and a good community aswell. You wont see fights maybe once or twice a year. Their are many opportunities and there is also a college now program where student would take college courses throught their entire highschool year.

For example, I am in the 8th grade and every Friday I go to PS 5 and tutor 2nd graders and then go to CCNY to take a college class. Good trips and most teachers are great and well liked by students.

I am most grateful for being able to attend an early college program which allowed me to graduate with 60 college credits (two years worth of courses) for free.

This year I'll be graduating and honestly, as my graduation day grows closer I feel more and more sad. The teachers there are caring and hardworking. If you ever have trouble not only can you go to the counselor but the teachers' doors  are always open. They care a lot about your education and you, in general. The friends I've made there are now my best friends for life. I've had more fun on school trips then any vacation I've ever taken. From Six flags, bowling, and AMC movie theatre trips  to a senior trip to Florida, they did it all. My experience at CCAA was amazing. Just so you know, they also have an early college program so you can earn more than 60 college credits before you graduate high school, that's two free years of college. You take the classes at City College, you get the privilege to experience going to college."", 'I love my school. It gives me so many opportunities with college readiness.

Landmark High School,"[""I transferred to Landmark High School at the start of my 10th grade year. I came from a regents based school to a performance based assessment school, the changes felt drastic but my teachers helped me transition smoothly. I'd say the staff give the students a great amount of support through all kinds of conflict whether personal or school related. I feel like this switch has better prepared me for college, the work is challenging and engaging, we have little conflict in school thanks to the restorative justice team who aids in deescalating arguments between students. I've thoroughly been enjoying my journey at this school, there has been nothing but growth since I first step foot inside Landmark."", 'I appreciated every second I stayed in my school, whether it was to volunteer for school events or just to stay for a couple more hours to complete any assignments.

Not to many courses that will satisfy students who are looking for a challenge.', 'I enjoyed my experience at Landmark Highschool.

They should be able to hear the students out for anything and not let them go down without a fight.', ""Overall, I've had a very engaging Landmark High School Experience. I've been able to experience a number of activities and clubs at this school. As a senior, I can reflect on the many extracurricular activities and events that the school has provided. The teachers and staff are very helpfull and supportive for the students in Landmark. The school also keeps the parents involved in student's lives inviting them to dinners and events after school. I mostly enjoyed the sport aspect of the school. Landmark really takes these sports serious and give students the hunger to come and play."", ""The school isn't the greatest. You have to climb up several floors to get to the class. The classes seem to be too full most of the time and the kids seem to mostly be rowdy. Besides all that it always seems like the teachers care for the students. They would always come to the students who needed help and do their best to help them. Most of the students get to really become friends with the teachers. No student really ever hates a teacher even if they had clashed heads before. Teachers are also extremely compassionate with students facing problems in their grades and social lives. They're like a second family."", 'Landmark high school has over 10 sports teams and some intermediate sports teams as well.

My favorite experience was getting to see NYC in a different perspective, thanks to the trips I had every friday in my freshmen and sophomore year.

There is also a music program called Midori where you can learn to play an instrument ranging from guitars to drums and pianos. There is even a dancing class where you can learn to dance rhumba and merenga At Landmark, you only need to keep an open mind to various activities available.', ""While there are a few athletic teams such as the basketball team the Landmark Titans and the softball team, there isn't a school wide spirit team.

The faculty at the high school can be very friendly and helpful on your next steps in life. Applying to college at this school is a breeze, the college advisor helps you a lot.

Initially, I was skeptical of how my academic career will unfold in this school however I have no regrets and cherish the memories I have made here. The plethora of community service opportunities offered in the Scholars club from tutoring at elementary schools to preparing school events has truly helped develop my character. A.P classes such as A.P Biology and A.P Chemistry which have allowed me to get a head start in my college career were not difficult at all due to my helpful teachers. The faculty has been more than supportive in terms of guiding students to pass classes and regents. Especially the counselors who go out of their way to create a college-going culture within our student body.

Bronx Compass  to me seemed like time is passing by really fast. I learned many valuable life lessons as well as a lot of  friends. I learned the value of hard work, dedication, and also how to tell your real friends from the others.Most of the good memories involved my good friends and most of the bad memories involved just me. Just good memories for me in general in Bronx Compass doing class projects,  as well as just seeing people in class everyday. !

The college counselor doesnt know how to help you  to get into top colleges and some teachers do preach community college.

What i also like about Academy Charter is that every Friday we a thing called ""Mentoring"" and during our elective class we go to our mentoring groups and talk, do activities and sometimes have parties. What i would like to see change is the grading system. instead of giving us our grades every month make a app so us students and parents can look for ourselves. I would like to see change is the lunch. The lunch there is very poor. i would like to see more sports and clubs for the students.', ""Academy charter is a good school, I like the fact that we have small classes and we have one on one with the teachers when we can get them.

We have a lot of turn over with teachers so it's not encouraging. We need better food and teachers that wants to stay and encourage kids to do better. The teachers that are there try to do their best and we appreciate them for that thank you.

You will never feel like you are lonely there is always someone you can talk to . Academy Charter is also like a big family, just like any other family we might fight, yell, argue, etc. with each other but at the end of the day we make up and go on about our day. What i also like about Academy Charter is that every Friday we a thing called ""Mentoring"" and during our elective class we go to our mentoring groups and talk, do activities and sometimes have parties. What i would like to see change is the grading system. instead of giving us our grades every month make a app so us students and parents can look for ourselves. I would like to see change is the lunch. The lunch there is very poor. i would like to see more sports and clubs for the students.', ""Academy charter is a good school, I like the fact that we have small classes and we have one on one with the teachers when we can get them. I like the fact that they have and encouraged kids with sports, the school itself is not a big school but we just need teachers that wants to stay in the school. We have a lot of turn over with teachers so it's not encouraging. We need better food and teachers that wants to stay and encourage kids to do better. The teachers that are there try to do their best and we appreciate them for that thank you.

In SVHS, of course, much room can be made for improvement. Unfortunately, there isn't a wide range of academic programs to choose from; your schedule can only be so diverse. Extracurricular activities are constantly on the chopping block. Areas that are in constant use i.e. the auditorium and bathrooms are in poor shape..Due to a lack of proper funding, we struggle. However, in the same light, it is here at SVHS where you are sure to find some of the most innovative minds and passionately-driven spirits. The staff and administration are constantly working towards benefiting the students. They meet the students where they're at and work to multiply their skill set. They give their students their BEST efforts. And they're not in the business of giving up easily.

Spring Valley adminstration though sometimes maybe very frustrating, they always pull through with wonders to teach the student about rising about their sircumstances. Over the years our school has made a name for itself between our sports program aswell as our drama and art. Spring Valley Highschool has a widespread design for indulging in a students interest and finding out how they can develope the student into what they want to make out of their interest.

But, when you look at the purpose of the school which is to help Hispanic/Latino students in making the transition to the US System. Then that factor is excused. Also, with the help of the different programs that students participate in, they are able to experience the exposure to other types of people and practices acceptance and respect for others. The biggest problem would be the administration. Any type of order is difficult to find in the school. From late diplomas, to missing documents, to not being able to find a person who can actually help you with what you need, etc. These problems hold back the potential of this school. Where sometimes the bad aspects can weight more than the good ones.', 'Have had 3 family members attend this school and all 3 have experienced delays in graduating due to the mismanagement of courses required for completion. The staff is inattentive to this matter and a good majority hardly speaks English. My niece had passed all her regents along with her classes but had to repeat a 5th year due to  the incompetent staff overlook a music and gym credit all while her program allowed for 2 free periods yet the staff was ""unable"" to fit something within her free time. They also discouraged her to take several regents exams because they believed she wasn\'t ready. She heavily insisted and was was finally granted permission. She scored well above her other classmates and silenced all who opposed. In conclusion, this school has a terrible staff administration.

Never have I experienced a school with such diversity among students, teachers that personally know and care about all of their kids, and just a wonderful atmosphere all together. As I write this, there have only been 4 graduating classes, so the highschool is still fairly young and still being worked on. This has not stopped the school, however, from providing one of the strongest senses of community and school pride I have ever seen. A lot of this community and pride comes from the freedom and trust facility enstill on students. Students are able to learn at their own pace, organize their own events, etc.  Students are given a sense of confidence when they are allowed independence. I am so grateful to have attended YMA. The people I have met and the experiences I have had are ones that will surely last a life time.', 'This is a great Montessori school.  Students are more self-directed here and that will be a blessing and a curse.  You might have to supplement the academics to keep on track, so I would budget some funds for that.  Talk to your kid often, because they are still developing the school and your feedback is all they need to help your kid get ready for life.  The diversity, safety and culture are really great.  Everybody is having fun and has a love of learning.   Anytime I have raised any concern with the school, the issue got resolved.  They do have some growing pains, because they are doing something rare and evolving here, so be involved.  This is a majority ""disadvantaged kid"" school and academic scores reflect that.  But this is not a place where disadvantaged = troubled.  These are great kids, teachers, administrators and parents who all care about your kid.  Why would you want to go anywhere else?', 'There are many teachers who are dedicated to their jobs and helping students succeed which is a great quality of this school. Although some administrators have a bad attitude the brilliant teachers make up for that which helps my plan to successfully graduate and move onto college.', ""My experience at Yonkers Montessori Academy has its Pros and Cons. One of the pros is has small community where everyone knows each other and it's like a family. There is no bullying which makes the school very comfortable.

Never have I experienced a school with such diversity among students, teachers that personally know and care about all of their kids, and just a wonderful atmosphere all together. As I write this, there have only been 4 graduating classes, so the highschool is still fairly young and still being worked on. This has not stopped the school, however, from providing one of the strongest senses of community and school pride I have ever seen. A lot of this community and pride comes from the freedom and trust facility enstill on students. Students are able to learn at their own pace, organize their own events, etc.  Students are given a sense of confidence when they are allowed independence. I am so grateful to have attended YMA. The people I have met and the experiences I have had are ones that will surely last a life time.', 'This is a great Montessori school.  Students are more self-directed here and that will be a blessing and a curse.  You might have to supplement the academics to keep on track, so I would budget some funds for that.  Talk to your kid often, because they are still developing the school and your feedback is all they need to help your kid get ready for life.  The diversity, safety and culture are really great.  Everybody is having fun and has a love of learning.   Anytime I have raised any concern with the school, the issue got resolved.  They do have some growing pains, because they are doing something rare and evolving here, so be involved.  This is a majority ""disadvantaged kid"" school and academic scores reflect that.  But this is not a place where disadvantaged = troubled.  These are great kids, teachers, administrators and parents who all care about your kid.

Me and friends all went to good colleges after coming here like Hunter,City college, Baruch ,Binghamton so there are opportunities here."", ""Science Skills Center High School has my made my 4 years enjoyable. When I first came into this school I had a very rough start and wasn't motivated for my freshmen year but as the years went by I Realized that this school grants you so much opportunities to take advantage of like being involved within the community, going on college campus tour s, free SAT prep programs. This school has so much to offer for it sudents."", 'My experience at Science Skills has been amazing. I love it here and I’m truly going to miss it.

Science Skills impacted my life so much.', 'Science Skills is a well-rounded school. Science Skills offers much programs and opportunities for students to be college ready', ""I liked the diversity and the many connections to become college ready. I don't like the design of the school."", 'When I first came to Science Skills High School i knew something was wrong the moment I looked at the building and it said Science ""KILLS"". The school was always warm, small, the gym looked nothing like a gym and the teachers were always there to help you when you needed it.  Misinterpreting the environment, I always thought why the school had poor facilities and never imagined it was once a factory. Even while facing the fact our school didn\'t have much to offer, I found out the school was warm because of the people who were so aspiring, helpful and bright. Whether it was during school life or during things that happen outside of school life, there was no circumstance that prevented a teacher from bonding with their student and making them strive for the best they can be. The teachers provided me the SKILLS I needed that would push me achieve more and to change lives like they did.', ""It took a while to get use to but once your in and meet everyone you'll find your place . Dont be shy coming in because there are big personalities there . And everyone is nice . The teachers are hard on you only because they care ."", 'The teachers and staff are very pleasant. The classroom sizes are not too large and the schedule is not overly taxing on students. There are however, four schools in the building and it can get a little loud sometimes being next to a major bridge.', ""I graduated from this school in 2013. So after I left I'm sure plenty of things have changed. While being at Science Skills, it had its ups and downs. Some teachers are very good and then you had teachers that weren't so good. I just wish we had a real gym, be more organized. Safety was another issue that sometimes I would worry about. This school definitely didn't prepare me for College at all. The things I know now wish I knew while I was there."", 'I think what many students want to see change is the building (Mainly the gym), uniform policy, school colors and some teachers. Other than that the school is pretty ok we share a building (Waters edge campus) with 3 other schools. We have a lot of opportunities such as AP classes /college credit classes/programs like college now, Internships, NHS (national honors society), student government and other student organizations that hold their own events. We have a decent amount of good teachers deans and assistant principals that are easy to talk to. We have an awesome program called PGC (peer group connections) where seniors and Juniors do activities in order bond with their peers, learn lessons and ask questions about our school. We have lots of clubs but not a lot of students join said clubs. Clubs are literally as simple as asking a teacher to supervise, get approval and get a number of students to sign up, I would know in my freshman year me and a few friends started an anime club.', ""Entering Science Skills Center High School freshman year of 2014 was exciting. Everyone in that school were open to new opportunities. SSCHS offers alot of good things academically. They have lots of good AP courses that gets you college ready. College Now is another college readiness opportunity SSCHS have. I would like them to change the uniform policy. I feel that not wearing uniform would express the students more. You'll have another way to tell students personality without even asking. Overall SSCHS helped me prepare for college wonderfully."", 'My experience at Science Skills Center was pretty good. I originally wanted to attend Fort Hamilton High School but I wasn’t accepted. I was admitted to a honors program so I didn’t mind attending Science Skills Center anymore. I was quite pleased with the school, because I was allowed to be apart of the summer bridge program which allowed me to take the living environment regents that I passed which made me happy, because that was one less regents I had to take. The program allowed for me to meet students who were and weren’t in my grade level and made me feel more comfortable in that environment. However, one thing I didn’t like about Science Skills Center  was that we weren’t allowed to take the algebra regents, because there was too much work to cover in that 5 week period of time.', ""Teachers and AP' s are the nicest I've encountered.  Principal is a terror!!!!!  No social or professional skills whatsoever.  Can't be trusted!"", 'I liked that the teachers worked in collaboration with students in order to help us be on track for graduation. It was basically a sort of ""no child left behind""  situation, for example, if you happened to be lacking credits the guidance counselor and principal meet with you to discuss your options, like having a zero period or having a late period.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I love science skill center high school I was class of 2019 I get in to a very good college I love the teachers at science skill they help me a lot  in all my classes', 'It is a small school with some great vibes .

The school was always warm, small, the gym looked nothing like a gym and the teachers were always there to help you when you needed it.  Misinterpreting the environment, I always thought why the school had poor facilities and never imagined it was once a factory. Even while facing the fact our school didn\'t have much to offer, I found out the school was warm because of the people who were so aspiring, helpful and bright. Whether it was during school life or during things that happen outside of school life, there was no circumstance that prevented a teacher from bonding with their student and making them strive for the best they can be.

So after I left I'm sure plenty of things have changed. While being at Science Skills, it had its ups and downs. Some teachers are very good and then you had teachers that weren't so good.

Other than that the school is pretty ok we share a building (Waters edge campus) with 3 other schools. We have a lot of opportunities such as AP classes /college credit classes/programs like college now, Internships, NHS (national honors society), student government and other student organizations that hold their own events. We have a decent amount of good teachers deans and assistant principals that are easy to talk to. We have an awesome program called PGC (peer group connections) where seniors and Juniors do activities in order bond with their peers, learn lessons and ask questions about our school. We have lots of clubs but not a lot of students join said clubs. Clubs are literally as simple as asking a teacher to supervise, get approval and get a number of students to sign up, I would know in my freshman year me and a few friends started an anime club.', ""Entering Science Skills Center High School freshman year of 2014 was exciting. Everyone in that school were open to new opportunities. SSCHS offers alot of good things academically. They have lots of good AP courses that gets you college ready. College Now is another college readiness opportunity SSCHS have. I would like them to change the uniform policy. I feel that not wearing uniform would express the students more. You'll have another way to tell students personality without even asking. Overall SSCHS helped me prepare for college wonderfully."", 'My experience at Science Skills Center was pretty good. I originally wanted to attend Fort Hamilton High School but I wasn’t accepted. I was admitted to a honors program so I didn’t mind attending Science Skills Center anymore. I was quite pleased with the school, because I was allowed to be apart of the summer bridge program which allowed me to take the living environment regents that I passed which made me happy, because that was one less regents I had to take. The program allowed for me to meet students who were and weren’t in my grade level and made me feel more comfortable in that environment. However, one thing I didn’t like about Science Skills Center  was that we weren’t allowed to take the algebra regents, because there was too much work to cover in that 5 week period of time.', ""Teachers and AP' s are the nicest I've encountered.
