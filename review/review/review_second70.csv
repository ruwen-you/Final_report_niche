I was unhappy and felt alone and had no idea who I was. I've struggled these past few years, but now I am in a place where my fashion is an expression of who I am, as I wear bright colors and different styles from various decades. I've cut my hair, and I'm happy. I know who I am and where I want to go. My teachers have been incredibly important to me and helped me get to this point.

The guidance counselors do an amazing job of keeping students prepared for college and making sure your ready for every obstacle in your way. The only reason why I took away that fifth star is safety. Overall we are safe as students, but the school can do much more. Students are allowed to leave campus in our junior and senior years which produces a safety risk. Also, there is no good system for checking id cards of students entering the building.

Most teachers are generally nice, although there are several exceptions to these rules. Most of these exceptions are terrible teachers and terrible people. There is no cafeteria in this school, so lunches have to be brought from home. There is only one sports team, which is soccer. The soccer team is the lowest ranking team in the lowest division.

No student should have to suffer four years under this administration.The principal and the guidance counselor are terrible at their jobs. They waited until the last day of school to confirm electives with students for the upcoming year, creating unnecessary chaos hours before the end of the school year in a frantic rush to rectify their mistakes.

It was awful. Her math teachers were good.', ""Don't come here. Yes, this school is of high ranking, but you will actually destroy your chances at going somewhere amazing and having a good high school experience if you come here. Your GPA will most likely be poor, the student body is always upset, the guidance counselor has made so many mistakes with college applications.

It was hard going to a place everyday where no one would talk to me; I felt invisible and every day became a struggle.

Mamaroneck High School,"['Students are very friendly and welcoming.

The school also offers a wide range and variety of clubs that are very fun!', ""I think that my experience so far at MHS, has been pretty good. I love the environment and the freedom because it makes me motivated to be successful. However, often times I feel like what I am learning in my classes aren't significant and we are often only learning material for the exam at the end of the year."", 'I wish that they offered APs or difficult classes earlier on but I do enjoy walking in the MHS doors in the mornings. Amazing music opportunities!!!', ""I was able to play volleyball all four years and got a family out of it. My coaches who support me beyond the court. Within my club at school, GSA, I was able to feel accepted and safe to be myself. The teachers here all show that they want to be here. It’s about making kids want to show everyday. The most amazing thing to come from my high school experience has to be the connections I made. It wasn't just the connection with my peers, it was the teachers who chose to see me. To see beyond a letter grade they could give me."", 'Mamaroneck High School was a great educational experience. The teachers are all extremely helpful and understanding. The resources offered by the school, such as the library were also amazing.', ""I think MHS was better than an average high school. I've always felt safe at the school and happy to have had so much freedom (open campus, free periods, etc). Overall, teachers are good in preparing you with the material, but I did come across some teachers that were somewhat inadequate. AP classes were challenging but definitely helped prepare me for college, although I do wish they offered more."", 'Mamaroneck High School is a great high school in Mamaroneck, New York. I had a wonderful four years at Mamaroneck High School, and it prepared me very well for college.', 'Leaving MHS, I felt prepared for college. There are teachers and guidance counselors at MHS that will change your life--they opened door for me, when I saw none. Very thankful for this school.', 'I loved mamaroneck high school. All the students are pretty nice to eachother and though there are cliques, like at every school, everyone is very welcoming and everyone talks to one another. There is virtually no bullying and it is a good environment to learn in because your classmates push you to succeed as well.', 'I liked the classes and some of the teachers but a lot of people juul in the bathrooms and I don’t like that', ""I like the amount of extracurricularactivities that it provides to all students. However, the thing I hate most is that this school's community is very divided. Cliques fill everywhere and people feel like they have to be with someone all the time or they'll get judged or be looked down by others. You could clearly see this social gap between boys and girls as well which is rather too apparent."", 'Athletics are fun, academics are great but RIGOROUS if you decide to take plenty of honors and AP courses especially junior year. If you care about your grades stay away from Spanish at all costs, as Spanish 3H (sophomore year) is the most difficult and punitive class in the entire school. Highly competitive environment academically, as scores of students aim for top 10 universities every year. Biggest problem with the school is stress and the somewhat segregated social scene. With all the stress, it’s unsurprising that Mamaroneck kids tend to really let loose on the weekends.', 'The school was over all good. I was in the APPLE programand they were very good on there education and how they would break thing down for us to we can learn it more clearer than the other students.', 'I honestly am so lucky to have attended this institution. This is one of the best high schools around and I would highly recommend the district to any family. Although it may not seem to be the most diverse, the elementary schools are currently more diverse than ever before and will add to the ethnic palette of the school, but we are still big on focusing on and empathizing with other cultures. So many faculty are there waiting for your needs. I had an amazing experience at this school and I will miss it dearly.', ""Mamaroneck High School is a great college-prepatory high school with a terrific assortment of AP class choices. I feel it has prepared my son very well for whatever college he ends up attending.  Our guidance counselor is absolutely top-notch and has been an invaluable guide for our family in the often-overwhelming college process.  I really wouldn't change anything except for two things -- (1) it would be nice to see more Honors classes at the freshman and sophomore levels, especially in English, and (2) I strongly believe that the annual award ceremony held by the school in the spring (that is invitation-only) should be for Seniors only.  The Junior year and lower categories seem to be more of a popularity contest, where awards go to the student who is most beloved by those who are deliberating rather than which student is the most deserving, has the highest academic achievement, or has the most accomplishments in their field of study both in and outside the school."", 'My overall experience at MHS has been great! The school has allowed me to really grow as both a student and a person since I started attending two years ago.', 'No College or University courses for advanced students available. Math is up to Calculus only for seniors. Very VERY average academics.  Students are entitled and very lazy in gym. Enthusiastic students are almost oblivious among the dull population. Everyone is ALWAYS ON THEIR PHONES.', ""teachers are great. Coursework is pretty rigorous if you want it to be, but even if classes aren't that hard, you don't get any free passes. sports are a blast and everyone can play. administration is kind of overbearing at times but mostly stays uninvolved in regular matters unless they need to be involved. overall feel ready for college and have a good foundation."", 'My four years in this school have been great.

I really wouldn't change anything except for two things -- (1) it would be nice to see more Honors classes at the freshman and sophomore levels, especially in English, and (2) I strongly believe that the annual award ceremony held by the school in the spring (that is invitation-only) should be for Seniors only.

Although the classes and workload can be difficult to manage, the teachers are (usually) great, there's a variety of club and activities, and typically everyone seems to find a group of people they hang out with.

Pelham Memorial High School,"['Pelham so far has been extremely enjoyable. Everything from Olympics from the classes have been fun and easy to get into. I see some other comments complaining about the racial tolerance but as a minority I never experienced any sort of racism in my entire life at Pelham. The people here are easy to get along with and the teachers truly care about the students. Pelham is a very good school overall and I’m happy to go here.', ""It is very safe and welcoming! Everyone's voice matters and it is a great school to be in if you want to learn and grow."", 'Great school with strong academics and school spirit. The school definitely caters to the affluent and is not very diverse.', ""A great small public high school and during my time there I was able to interact with interesting and engaging peers and students. However, the school did not prepare me well for college because there was barely any reading for classes. There is a huge divide in the student body between wealthier, white students  and students within the community that struggle financially. If you don't take advantage of certain resources at the school you get stuck without a great support system from the student body/teachers. I know many students that would skip class regularly and the teachers wouldn't even bother to help them. As for the teachers, it really is a mixed bag; I had probably 5-7 teachers that had engaging classes. Other teachers did not care if you did your work and would put on videos the entire class because they had nothing better to teach."", ""I wasn't like the vast majority of kids who went to school in Pelham. Sure, I went to Pelham schools throughout my youth, but what separated me from everyone else was that I didn't live in Pelham. As someone who didn't live with everyone else, I still felt welcomed by the community and I honestly feel like I was more-so raised in Pelham than in my actual town. Most students are very nice, and the teachers are always more than willing to help you succeed, because that's their most important objective. What made my years in Pelham so special to me was the school's spirit. Every grade brings a new level of school spirit, and when everyone comes together, whether it's for homecoming or olympics, it just goes to show just how much everyone loves the community and how special of a town Pelham really is. That's what made me fall in love with Pelham."", ""It's a good school and it pushes you and keeps you on a higher education level than you may be at in another school. However, there are resources to help anyone in need and teachers are mostly helpful and understanding."", 'My experience at PMHS was fantastic from start to finish. As part of the 2018 class who won two olympics, a witness to the historic 2016-2017 pvp hockey team, the 2015-16 and 16-17 rugby teams, and so many other great achievements, I have incredible love for the community and school and will cherish the people I met and memories forever.', 'My experience at PMHS was great! Each student has so many options when it comes to courses to enroll in and each teacher cares about you.  The access to a variety of resources such as student chromebooks and a large library help set students up for success.', 'Pelham Memorial High School is the classic medium to large sized public school that has set its standards very high in comparison to other public schools around the nation. The determination of the teachers to help the students is impeccable. But the problem is that the teachers are always required to have a minimum amount of homework, tests, or quizzes. Especially in the case of the language department where many times we would be faced with two to three assessments a week. Socially, if you play sports, and like to push your liver to the brink, you will have no problem feeling welcomed by other groups. Otherwise, you can easily feel unwelcomed because of the close-minded peers that you share the halls with.', 'There are many things I like about my school, but I believe the single thing that makes it stand out, is the effort put out by the teachers. The teachers create a personal bond with students that enable us to be comfortable with coming after school, asking questions during class time, and talk about and personal troubles we are having. I believe that has certainly helped me seek help to understand tough curriculum, and help when I needed it the most.', 'No bullying and lots of school spirit! Variety of courses to take. Teachers are obviously passionate about what they do and caring towards their students. Students truly have a voice here.', ""As a student that just graduated from PMHS, I just want to say that I had a good 4 years there. This school provided me with a range of opportunities that I wouldn't have received in the previous location I lived in. All of their teachers truly enjoy what they are doing and genuinely care for the students. As a former student, our voices could be heard in PMHS, which I really appreciated."", 'My experience at Pelham Memorial High School has been one of great prestige. Not only have I grown as an individual and young adult, but I have adapted many skills that consist of interacting with people, especially my teachers. Attending Pelham Memorial High School is more than getting a high school degree, as the staff there is truly dedicated with providing students, such as myself, with the best experience possible.', ""The teachers put their best efforts to help you understand the material.  They give you a choice of many different types of activities/clubs to help you figure out your interests. It's a very friendly environment and their is support all around. This school also offers open enrollment so you choose between  different class to find the one that best suits you.  Finding a good collage is hard,  the counselors here do everything to make sure your attending your best fit collage."", 'Overall, PMHS is a great school. There are many great teachers who are always willing to stay after school and help you out.', 'I loved growing up in Pelham and lived there all my life until graduating and attending the University of Alabama.', 'every ones is friendly, but can be a little materialistic and money oriented at times. Other than that they are hard working well rounded golden boys and girl scouts it a really sports and academic school. with a great small town vibe.', ""I like Pelham although it could use a few changes. The food is horrible I haven't been to the cafeteria since freshmen year. Most of the teachers are awesome, but some are the opposite. There's definetly a lot of resources and opportunities available to prepare you for college."", 'Really nice school.

Everything from Olympics from the classes have been fun and easy to get into. I see some other comments complaining about the racial tolerance but as a minority I never experienced any sort of racism in my entire life at Pelham. The people here are easy to get along with and the teachers truly care about the students. Pelham is a very good school overall and I’m happy to go here.', ""It is very safe and welcoming! Everyone's voice matters and it is a great school to be in if you want to learn and grow."", 'Great school with strong academics and school spirit. The school definitely caters to the affluent and is not very diverse.', ""A great small public high school and during my time there I was able to interact with interesting and engaging peers and students. However, the school did not prepare me well for college because there was barely any reading for classes. There is a huge divide in the student body between wealthier, white students  and students within the community that struggle financially. If you don't take advantage of certain resources at the school you get stuck without a great support system from the student body/teachers. I know many students that would skip class regularly and the teachers wouldn't even bother to help them. As for the teachers, it really is a mixed bag; I had probably 5-7 teachers that had engaging classes. Other teachers did not care if you did your work and would put on videos the entire class because they had nothing better to teach."", ""I wasn't like the vast majority of kids who went to school in Pelham. Sure, I went to Pelham schools throughout my youth, but what separated me from everyone else was that I didn't live in Pelham. As someone who didn't live with everyone else, I still felt welcomed by the community and I honestly feel like I was more-so raised in Pelham than in my actual town. Most students are very nice, and the teachers are always more than willing to help you succeed, because that's their most important objective. What made my years in Pelham so special to me was the school's spirit. Every grade brings a new level of school spirit, and when everyone comes together, whether it's for homecoming or olympics, it just goes to show just how much everyone loves the community and how special of a town Pelham really is. That's what made me fall in love with Pelham."", ""It's a good school and it pushes you and keeps you on a higher education level than you may be at in another school. However, there are resources to help anyone in need and teachers are mostly helpful and understanding."", 'My experience at PMHS was fantastic from start to finish. As part of the 2018 class who won two olympics, a witness to the historic 2016-2017 pvp hockey team, the 2015-16 and 16-17 rugby teams, and so many other great achievements, I have incredible love for the community and school and will cherish the people I met and memories forever.', 'My experience at PMHS was great! Each student has so many options when it comes to courses to enroll in and each teacher cares about you.  The access to a variety of resources such as student chromebooks and a large library help set students up for success.', 'Pelham Memorial High School is the classic medium to large sized public school that has set its standards very high in comparison to other public schools around the nation. The determination of the teachers to help the students is impeccable. But the problem is that the teachers are always required to have a minimum amount of homework, tests, or quizzes. Especially in the case of the language department where many times we would be faced with two to three assessments a week. Socially, if you play sports, and like to push your liver to the brink, you will have no problem feeling welcomed by other groups. Otherwise, you can easily feel unwelcomed because of the close-minded peers that you share the halls with.', 'There are many things I like about my school, but I believe the single thing that makes it stand out, is the effort put out by the teachers. The teachers create a personal bond with students that enable us to be comfortable with coming after school, asking questions during class time, and talk about and personal troubles we are having. I believe that has certainly helped me seek help to understand tough curriculum, and help when I needed it the most.', 'No bullying and lots of school spirit! Variety of courses to take. Teachers are obviously passionate about what they do and caring towards their students. Students truly have a voice here.', ""As a student that just graduated from PMHS, I just want to say that I had a good 4 years there. This school provided me with a range of opportunities that I wouldn't have received in the previous location I lived in. All of their teachers truly enjoy what they are doing and genuinely care for the students. As a former student, our voices could be heard in PMHS, which I really appreciated."", 'My experience at Pelham Memorial High School has been one of great prestige. Not only have I grown as an individual and young adult, but I have adapted many skills that consist of interacting with people, especially my teachers. Attending Pelham Memorial High School is more than getting a high school degree, as the staff there is truly dedicated with providing students, such as myself, with the best experience possible.', ""The teachers put their best efforts to help you understand the material.  They give you a choice of many different types of activities/clubs to help you figure out your interests. It's a very friendly environment and their is support all around. This school also offers open enrollment so you choose between  different class to find the one that best suits you.  Finding a good collage is hard,  the counselors here do everything to make sure your attending your best fit collage."", 'Overall, PMHS is a great school. There are many great teachers who are always willing to stay after school and help you out.', 'I loved growing up in Pelham and lived there all my life until graduating and attending the University of Alabama.', 'every ones is friendly, but can be a little materialistic and money oriented at times. Other than that they are hard working well rounded golden boys and girl scouts it a really sports and academic school. with a great small town vibe.', ""I like Pelham although it could use a few changes. The food is horrible I haven't been to the cafeteria since freshmen year. Most of the teachers are awesome, but some are the opposite.

I understand that they have more experience and know how exactly a kid should be raised, but it doesn't change the fact that they do make certain things very inconvenient for us students.  As students I feel like we should have some say in how the school is run rather than handing all the authority over to staff and parents.

Other than that, it is a great school filled with amazing, passionate teachers. The education is great. ', ""Since NEST is a Gifted and Talented school (G&T), the curriculum is accelerated and more advance when compared to other schools. In middle school you were able to take high school level classes and it would be put toward your future high school GPA.

The teachers were engaging and tried to teach in such away that every student could learn. In lower school our grade was not very large; each class had less than thirty students. By middle school, we had over two hundred students in the grade and a little over thirty students per class. The cafeteria serves food with slightly better quality than the typical public school, and the academics are more rigorous than the typical public school.

This leads to the first few weeks of the school year leaving students anxious as they hope they get the courses they are qualified to take. Not only is there a lack of courses in high demand, but some students who manage to be put into AP courses do not meet prerequisite requirements, removing space for students who do meet the requirements.

When I was in the eight grade I was diagnosed with an Auditory Processing Disorder; this diagnosis relieved me of my constant fear that I was just not as “smart” as the other kids. Once diagnosed I was able to narrow down my tactics and work on other possible tactics that would give me a higher chance in becoming a successful high school student.

The teachers provide a comfortable atmosphere for their students; granting them extra time when needed or the opportunity to stop by and ask them a question about work from class.

Some teachers have a hard time making exceptions to their policies, even when the situation warrants one.

J.P treats the other aspects of normal high school life as nonexistent. The facilities are disgusting and full of muck, with the only exception being the vape-consumed B wing.

It is also lacking in diversity as 70-80% of the students are Asian. This creates extremely high academic pressure as students rarely sleep and have a toxic influence of competitiveness. If you're not studying, you're falling behind. This leads to a lot of cheating in the honors programs. Generally, the students and teachers are nice, though it is high school.

On one hand, it is a very high leveled college prep high school which excels in academics and extracurriculars. However, this is the farthest I can go with this school. The rigorous and mentally straining expectations of performing up to par at this school often psychologically tortures the minds of its students. J.P treats the other aspects of normal high school life as nonexistent. The facilities are disgusting and full of muck, with the only exception being the vape-consumed B wing. The hallways and classrooms are way too crowded and humid, with the school having a demographic of over 2,000 students. If we're to receive the privilege of Macbook Airs for every single student, you might as well spend the rest of the budget on gold-studded toilets."", 'This is a great school in general but the competition between students is insane.  The teachers are very helpful and prepare the students for exams and testing. The diversity is incredible and there are so many clubs the students could join. While the school itself is very crowded the administration is looking for a way to help the overcrowding issue.', 'Overall this is a public school and the students who attend have allowed it to develop competitive nature. For students who work well under stress, this environment is a great motivator but for other students, the environment may be overwhelming. In my experience, this school enabled me to work hard in order to stand out amongst the other 2000+ students who attend the school.', ""JP Stevens has the best teachers and some great resources such as presentations about college and interviews and resumes and applications. They also have so many clubs so anyone can find their interests and they offer challenging subjects. I would say that some people are too competitive though. Also the food (Chartwells) is not the worst but definitely not worth your money. It's literally price gouging - students with working parents have no other option than to buy lunch so Chartwells outrageously charges $3.25 for a slice of nasty frozen pizza. But that's not really the school's fault?? But JP also has really good security and AWESOME teachers. We need to pay them more."", 'This high school prepares you for college and how to handle yourself with a competitive environment and challenging classes. Unfortunately, since the school is very focused with college prep, it neglects the other aspect of high school life. There are issues of bullying, low school pride, cheating and too many cases of low self-esteem among the student body. The teachers and faculty are nice. They help you if you need help and the teachers engage themselves with the students which makes the class environment friendly and increases class involvement. Like every public high school, the food is terrible, but some days the food is above average. It is also very diverse and its nice to be introduced and grow up in a diverse environment before heading out to college.', 'This is a very academic based and competitive school. However, when it comes to athletics, I think it can improve on soccer and football.', 'I graduated in 2018. Was a love/hate relationship. Hated the start time. Loved early release. Hated half the student body for being complete nerds. Loved the athletic programs. Nice teachers. Mean popular kids. Great Administrators. Bad use of money. Great facilities. Stupid greenhouse. Great enviorment. Stupid macbooks. Great lunch. Too crowded. New SMALL HALF STACKED LOCKERS, over crowding.', ""Lot of competitions! This school is kept clean.  Stronger arts programs. Higher quality teaching. Poor communication availability between parent/guardian with teachers, have heard about unsafe school environment but lucky yet didn't get such experience!"", ""Good academics. Facilities can be improved.  It's too overcrowded and definitely over the maximum capacity for the building. The teachers and academics are very good, if the facilities and overpopulations issues were fixed it would be a really great school."", ""The school overall is pretty good, but many aspects of its culture are quite messed up. Primarily, it is lacking in overall school spirit as the sports teams are not very good. Not to mention the overcrowdedness of the hallways in the cramped building without even an AC or adequate bathrooms tends to dampen moods. It is also lacking in diversity as 70-80% of the students are Asian. This creates extremely high academic pressure as students rarely sleep and have a toxic influence of competitiveness. If you're not studying, you're falling behind. This leads to a lot of cheating in the honors programs. Generally, the students and teachers are nice, though it is high school. JP is good for you if you excel in academics and enjoy competition, not so much if always being stressed is not your thing. Either way, it will mess up your mental health from the cutthroat competitiveness."", 'Many of the features of this school are great, but the tough competitiveness that lurks within the students of this school is annihilating. Nowadays I feel so insecure about my grades because of how tough the people at this school are. However, they have some really amazing mentors, whom I will remember for the rest of my life. Overall, there are good things and bad things about JP.', ""JP Stevens is a great place for academics and extracurriculars. The teachers are top notch and go out of their way to help you -- but the disparity between the academic groupings is getting more pronounced every year. Sure, more and more kids are being pushed into the Honors/AP track, but the students in Levels 1 and 2 are being left behind. The music program is undoubtedly one of the best in the state, but gets *just enough* funding to carry on. People are open-minded but not that nice -- there's definitely an atmosphere of competition that sometimes makes students not want to help each other. Overall this is a great school, but still has some issues with its culture that we have to fix."", 'My experience at JPS was very positive ,it prepared me for college.THere are alot of club ND ACTIVITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN AND PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY VERY OPEN MINDED AND FRIENDLY.THE SCHOOL IS NOT VERY GOOD FOR sports, we are well known for tennis though. Academics is the key highlight o the school with student scores in standerdzed testing being extremly high. The choir and orchestra is also well renouned and people usually hod the high school in high regards. The population isvery saturated by south indian so oving to this district can be a challenge, you should review all aspects of the school before commiting to it.', ""I am now a senior at J.P Stevens High School and my experience was a pleasant one. Having been at this school for four years I never had a terrible experience. Academically the school is very great. So are the teachers. J.P. is definitely diverse and there is a lot of clubs and activities you can join. I feel very safe when i come into school because of the rules and drills we do and have. The theatre company puts on amazing productions and does a beautiful job year after year. But, of course there are some negatives. Our sports teams are just average as well as our food and resources. The facilities for students are terrible sometimes you have to walk to the other side of the school just to get to the bathroom. Parent involvement is depleting because parents are getting lazy. But, all in all I can't imagine going to high school anywhere else. J.P. Stevens is truly a place where you go in a kid and graduate an adult."", 'J.P. Stevens High School has a great academic program. Most teachers may have a hard curriculum, but they all care about the students here. The environment is a very fun and casual one. It is very easy to make friends in this school with the student count.', 'As a student who has attended JP, it is true that the emphasis placed on college is quite extreme. Most students only talk about college and stress about their applications; our educators also taught us based off of a curriculum geared towards getting a ""5"" on the AP exam. It\'s crazy that a school can be so focused on college.  There is pretty much no school culture compared to other high schools here at JP either, as most kids don\'t have time to take a break for studying to come out. I have made a decent amount of friends here as well, but none of them I see as people I would keep in touch with in the future. Overall, I was happy with my experience and college readiness, but JP lacked in developing any school culture and always has a rigid atmosphere.', 'As much as I dislike going to school, JPS does provide me with the best education possible and I honestly could not be anymore thankful. I have been able to not only learn so much academically, but also great lifetime friendships. I will miss the place I called home for 4 years after graduating and look forward to coming back whenever I can!', 'The teachers at JP vary, some can be quite great, while others mediocre. There are a plethora of clubs and sports to join, but very low diversity as everyone here is Asian. Academics is one of the most highly regarded aspects of this school, but it is based solely on students rather than teachers.', 'Although the environment is very challenging as everyone is trying to compete against each other, the school overall is a good resource to prepare students for attending college and applying for jobs.

The array of courses are deep, enriching, and rigorous. Even the variety of activities for students is endless with varsity sports, intramural leagues, and clubs.

The infrastructure is deteriorating along with the fields which have been deemed toxic by the EPA. The Board of Education gave students Chromebooks to enhance the learning experience, however the network infrastructure is week and null that using a device for learning is frustrating; not the supportive tool one hoped for.

However, I t’s also not the most diverse school, but Greenwich is not really a diverse town. A lot of kids are really preppy, but not everyone is if you find the right kids.

The array of courses are deep, enriching, and rigorous. Even the variety of activities for students is endless with varsity sports, intramural leagues, and clubs. But the school is busting out of its seams as the only public high school in a town of approximately 63,000 people. The infrastructure is deteriorating along with the fields which have been deemed toxic by the EPA. The Board of Education gave students Chromebooks to enhance the learning experience, however the network infrastructure is week and null that using a device for learning is frustrating; not the supportive tool one hoped for.  In fact, since there are no usable lockers the devices have become 6-lb burdens on backs and shoulders throughout the school day.

Our soccer, basketball, and lacrosse programs are fantastic and the most popular (good in individual sports like swimming and tennis as well). The facilities and food at the school are mediocre. Briarcliff definitely is lacking in diversity and school spirit. The school is in what many call the ""Briarcliff Bubble"", because the vast majority of the kids have grown up in the town all their life and do not understand how different the real world is.', ""-High School Junior-Students have a wide variety of classes to pursue.-Teachers are usually nice and care about you.-Clubs are varied but may not be worthwhile. -School culture is strong, especially in sports-Sports have excellent coaches and facilities-Resources are great for the most part. Our new MacBook Pros allows us to do more than ever.-Parent Involvement in sports, clubs, and administration is noticeable and strong. -Diversity is alright with most people being Caucasian and then Asian, Latino, African-American, and Other in that order of commonality. (My opinion) -College Readiness appears to be strong with many going to good colleges-Safety is good-Administration appears to be good-Food is mostly good quality -Facilities are very good including classrooms, bathrooms, and athleticsUnfortunately, Briarcliff doesn't seem to do much to help students that don't have the mental drive for academics or take a long time to complete tests."", ""The high school is a high performing school for its intense sense of competitiveness and offers different opportunities and experiences to even the newest students. Its student body is overall fun and energetic. As for teachers and faculty, they all are great people once you get to know them  and are actively helping students whenever possible. If you are a student looking for a challenge, this place is a perfect fit. However, you may need to help yourself when it comes to joining clubs as there isn't the grandest spectrum of subjects for extracurricular activities. As well as that, Briarcliff  places the student in a strong role to guide themselves to reach out for help, find out information about colleges or courses, and even look for scholarships. Upon entering the high school, you think you know it all, but once you graduate, you know really understand how much more you should learn once you're off to college!"", 'Overall, a good school with a lot of support structure.

I can proudly say that I have created as many friends and bonds with students as I possibly could at Ardsley High School  Having this said, I also learned that not everyone is accepting of who you are, and of the background that you come from.  This is something that I have also accepted as an individual.  The most important thing that I have learned through my 12 years in Ardsley is that you have to be accepting of yourself, and to not change yourself in order to be accepted by other.  Because of this, I would most certainly attend Ardsley High School again if I could do it all over again, so that I can re-learn the very important pieces of information which has been taught to me inside and outside of the classroom."", 'The teachers at Ardsley High School are always there to help students succeed to the best of their abilities.

Of course, the ninth period is not required for all students to use, therefore some students do not take advantage of the period.

The school places a lot of emphasis on academics and athletics, too.\r Ardsley is unique in the way that out of the Rivertowns, we place a lot of emphasis on having a good academic record but also having a diverse experience. Students are encouraged to join a variety of different clubs and sports, as well as school events, and to interact with their peers. We're also one of the smallest towns, as well. The AHS class graduating has about 160 students graduating this year and I can tell you the names of every one of us, and also provide an accurate physical description. That's how small we are. \r I love the different academics that the school offers, but at the same time, everyone is independently competitive within their social circles. All of my friends took at least 3 AP classes, and some take as many as 5 APs in a single year. Teachers provide enough help though, if you decide to take it.

She was physically violent with students there, and since the police report or something along those lines was messed up, they couldn't properly fire her. The only reason why I don't give a 1 star review, is because there are some teachers that actually care about their jobs. Most of the teachers in each major care about their students and whether or not they learn.

They don't care about the children in the school, they only care about their image and the amount of funding they are getting. Since dropping $160 million on a building that is falling a part, they have demoted and fired performing art teachers. LISTEN to this: the current musical theater teacher was transferred from County Prep. Do you want to know why? She was physically violent with students there, and since the police report or something along those lines was messed up, they couldn't properly fire her. The only reason why I don't give a 1 star review, is because there are some teachers that actually care about their jobs. Most of the teachers in each major care about their students and whether or not they learn. If you love your child, do not send them to High Tech until they decide to either change administrator or change the way they run the schools. This is a place of learning, not a place for political agendas."", ""I believe that High Tech High School is a great school where I can truly express myself while also feeling comfortable.

The guidance counselors and college counselors are very involved aand on top of making sure students do not feel extremely stressed throughout the process.

It allowed students to take college level courses for an open opportunity to earn college credits. The school offered a diverse variety of classes including Latin, Greek, and theater which are courses not common in other high schools. Moreover, the teachers at this school demonstrate a huge determination to help students better their education. They constantly invest time after school such as office hours for extra tutoring. Despite its vast investment in education, the school lacks funding therefore it cannot afford a large range of programs or clubs. The clubs and activities within the school are highly limited and thus fail to cater to every student. I think with more government funding towards the school, they can invest in more support for things outside of solely academics and will overall, improve the community of the school.', ""Love most of the teachers here, most of them are really invested in students' well beings.

If a student is willing to put in the work required by such a demanding school, they will truly reap what they sow. Sure, with every freshman and sophomore class being honors, and most junior and senior classes being International Baccalaureate (IB), TBLS is by no means easy.

If you are really shy or have stage fright this is not a good school for you to attend. This school participates in the International Baccalaureate program. In other schools families would have to pay around 1200 dollars for their children to participate in the program, however, this school pays for each student's participation. This causes the school to have disadvantages.

The workload can be stressful, especially with extracurriculars, and require sincere time management. Teachers do have office hours which can be used to get ahead on work, and many will let you work during lunch in their classroom. One thing we do lack is funding (we are a relatively new public school). We utilize Donors Choose and get many opportunities from that.

I am a freshman here and I\'m taking conceptual physics while my friends at Tech or Bard are taking courses such as AP physics and such with qualifications lower than mine. The ""conceptual physics"" is at such a rudimentary level that it is very challenging for many of my peers who are intrigued by science to sustain their interest of science in school. I was very excited to learn that TBLS had an up and running Science Olympiad club, which of course, turned out to be bogus. This school is also not for the creative mind either. We do have drama, art and A capella, but their organization and execution is worse than my middle school. But this school teachs in an unconventional way which could be a hit or miss.

Although it is understandable that we are trying to be prepared for college and a more rigorous curriculum, but sometimes it is a bit ridiculous.', 'Attending this school was an overall great experience. The diverse community and activities made the school feel very lively. The work may be a bit too cumbersome at times but I would recommend this school to those willing to put in the effort.', ""The Brooklyn Latin School follows an IB curriculum which is argued as more rigorous than AP. The school life can be very hard especially if the commute is long. You have 2-3 hours of hw everyday but the teachers are really helpful and available at office hours for extra help. There are many clubs and sports but honestly, they aren't the most highest quality. I really do not like the facility because it has really disgusting restrooms, lead-filled water fountains, shared gym, shared school building, and overall nothing high end. The budgets are very low for facilities and its uncomfortable. On the other hand though, the school community is very welcoming and supportive towards each other. Very open minded environment with approachable people."", ""TBLS is a full IB school, making it very rigorous, but not competitive. Even if you aren't on track to getting the IB Diploma, you will have no choice but to take IB classes, which are college level. However, the rigor of the school will prepare you for college really well, better than most schools. The school is committed to diversity and we have a really wonderful community, it's small, but the absolute best thing about the school is how committed the teachers are and how easy it is to talk to them, as most of them are younger (still wonderful teachers) and approachable, providing students a strong support system for the rigor of the classes. The school, however, does not receive enough money, leaving students without basic things like textbooks or a library, as what little funding we have, is spent on IB, so the students don't have to pay for it.  But the commitment the school has to excellence isn't stopped by the low funding."", ""TBLS is a good school in terms of the academics it has and the workload they give definitely provides the individual with a college ready feel yet at the same time the academics they provide are limited, especially classes in the arts and social sciences. Since the school runs on the IB programme a lot of money goes into the classes we take junior and senior year which detracts from the amount of money that is able to come into the school itself. Bathroom facilities for both boys and girls are in poor conditions. The boys' bathroom has permanently remained smelly, even after cleaning. People have to cover both their noses and mouths as soon as the door opens because the smell is terribly horrid. While the girls bathroom does not smell as bad, several of the toilets have become flooded and have stopped working, and at some point, a piece of the ceiling fell off. Due to the strength of our academics, we should obtain more funding."", ""Brooklyn Latin is a very challenging school because unlike other schools, it has an IB curriculum, instead of AP. IB is a very rigorous program and it's really useful for college because it not only gives us college credits by passing the classes, it also prepares us for the work in college.Brooklyn Latin has so many different aspects from other schools, which makes a lot of students dislike it because it seems really extra to have to many different aspects but honestly, the special things about Brooklyn Latin is extremely helpful and it does more good than bad to its students. The school is extremely small, with only about 600-700 students but this small environment makes our school community extremely close."", 'The Liberal Arts Curriculum is superb. I was learning about the myth of Laocoon in English and Latin, while analyzing the work of art featuring Laocoon in Art History, while studying Ancient Roman civilization in History. Brooklyn Latin also has a very tight-knit community that immediately recognizes people of diverse backgrounds and perspectives. The Roman/Latin culture also enhances that sense of community. Students, teachers and administrators all take part  in the nomenclature of calling students ""discipuli"", teachers ""magistri"", the bathroom ""latrina"", etc. The teachers above all care about the success and comfort of the students. You wouldn\'t believe how many teachers will pause class to talk about something not related to academics because that was where our minds were.', 'The Brooklyn Latin School allowed for me to go past my comfort zone. It is a school that stresses public speaking, and with assessments like seminar and declamation, I was able to learn how to communicate better with other people. It taught me the true meaning of having a family, for I was in a supportive environment where the teachers truly wanted me to thrive. I am proud of the student I have become, for I have this desire for learning and becoming more well-rounded.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

In just recent months, I have witnessed several instances of discrimination (swastikas, racial slurs, etc) - most of which administration has done nothing about.

As for the teachers... I think most students have an adult they could go to in school, but I get the sense that forming relationships with students either isn\'t encouraged, or the teachers just don\'t know that their job is more than textbooks and test scores.

My biggest complaint is the people at the school. It being so small there are only so many people you can talk to this creating a lack of social mobility and a clique culture. As far as the facilities, they’re what you might expect from a very old building. The water fountains are absurdly slow, the heating system doesn’t really work so well, and a lot of rooms have no A/C. That being said, the custodial staff is fantastic and they’re very committed to the school. They keep the building very clean and are very quick about fixing anything that breaks. They’re also so friendly and have no issue with helping you retrieve a forgotten item from a locked room. The guidance department is top notch and the administration is very supportive of student activities.', ""I was excited to start high school as a Freshman, but it was a tough transition. I regret not working hard enough, but I still got A LOT out of my high school experience. The extracurriculars were fantastic and I loved my friends. I had elusive relationships with my teachers and they're exceptionally talented. I would constantly go after school to chat with them and I still keep intouch with them. The teachers changed my global perspective, (most people just enhance it), helped me become a real thinker/question things, and prepared me for LIFE. The majority of people in the world will NEVER LEARN what students at HHS learn. You have agency and don't take your education for granted. I sorely miss this place and the innocence of high school, but once you graduate, you'll have THIS experience for the rest of your life."", ""Hastings highschool is truly a unique learning experience inside the classroom and out. The teachers are amazing and you will take them for granted until it is time to leave. The actual students attending the school are mostly all very privileged and very wealthy so if you don't fit that mold you will be an outsider, but it is honestly worth it for the education you will receive. It's a great community if you are musically inclined or enjoy theatre, any of the arts really. There are very strong programs. Honestly you will find your place no matter what you like. Athletics are more or less a joke besides soccer, even the teams who do well won't get attention because they are not soccer. But the boys variety soccer team did win states so that's cool!

Through its myriad of AP or IB courses and the assistance that each individual teacher provides, the faculty of WMMHS is dedicated to helping students learn, and succeed, in a variety of subjects. The guidance office is helpful in guiding students through the college process and in personal counseling as well. In terms of sports, I've participated in a variety of them over the past 4 years.

It is rated high as far as public high schools go in the state of NJ. My personal experience was fine overall, but after experiencing a private school for a year, the personal vested interest in students is vastly different and superior in an independent high school. Although rules and bureaucracy must exist in a large public high school, I suppose, but students should be allowed more freedom for self-expression, and there should be more room for individualized learning. This high school exists in an upper-middle-class suburb, and some days I felt like I was walking the halls of an institution. If it weren't for my friends and the few good teachers I had, I will say that if you can afford an independent school, go to one. This is a nice high school, it has good honors classes and a good athletic department, but if I have to look back on it, nothing really stands out."", 'WMMHSD is a very nice high school, with great teachers and classes.

The bathrooms are gross and the toilet seats need to be changed. We have lots of sports but most of the time no one goes to the games.  The big problem is that freshmen eat lunch on the floor.

The facility is beautiful, they have many resources, and the teachers are excellent.  All classes are honors level courses, so the academics are very challenging. The teachers are very proactive and do not leave any students behind.  Although APA is an amazing school academically, they are not a very diverse school.  Since its very selective in their acceptance process, the school is predominately white.  As a diverse student myself, I have never felt out of place here at APA.

It’s to the point that almost every Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior knows me by name! Of course the school isn’t perfect, and I’d love to see them be able to build an additional theatre to the Black Box, but one of the many awesome things about APA is that every year it’s growing and adapting to the new batch of students walking through its doors and learning from those who are graduating.', ""This school has made me so happy.

I would not be the actor I am today without the incredible and immersive theatre training I received. That being said, I do believe because it is a new school that there is a lot regarding safety and class development that needs to be worked on.

Every day I attended the school I felt as if I was learning something valuable and something I would need later in life; which I know now was correct. Also, being able to attend a school that fostered the arts and expression in such a fashion were also extremely valuable. The theatre, and rest of my academic classes, I received at APA and the rest of UCVTS were some of the best in the state, and in fact according to US NEWS Reports; some of the best in the country.

The only thing that is different from other schools is the fact that we don't have any sports teams, but are allowed to go back to our district high school to play sports there. The academics, although tough, push the students to work harder and if they prove to be difficult for students they can reach out to the teachers and peer tutors for extra help. The school is a very open environment and it encourages students to tap into their creative side and feel comfortable.  Every time I walk into school I never feel like I am in danger, and always feel safe and protected by the security guards and teachers. Any child would be extremely fortunate to attend the Academy for Performing Arts!"", 'Attending the Academy for Performing Arts has allowed me to study and cultivate my passion for dance.  The small study body afforded me the opportunity to get individualized attention and learning.  The staff is very supportive.

My overall high school experience at The Academy for Performing Arts has been unique and has been so rewarding.', 'I liked how there was only four classes per day because there was less stress put  on students since we had at least two days to complete every assignment. The chromebook laptops the school gave us to use throughout high school is helpful for writing assignments but does not help in research projects because most websites are blocked. I do not like how the faculty does not care if you fail in a particular class and say it is up to the student to do well.  Opinions like that, in my experience did not make me feel confident or comfortable in learning new material and when I did put the effort and tried to stay after school to work with a teacher, but they cancelled.

However, many sites are blocked on them so writing reports with sources is a bit of a struggle. The cafeteria on campus has food that is a bit overpriced for students but they have the lunch program for low-income families to apply to.

As someone who hates using public restrooms, I must say that the APA facilities are very clean. Our administrators are like second parents to us. My principal is an African American woman and she is one of the most inspirational people I have ever met. We spend our senior year at Kean University taking all college courses, receiving college credits. There are 3 boys in my grade, surprisingly none of which are gay.

My theatre education was excellent, though there was not a great deal of flexibility in exploring outside of my major. This year, I am a senior, and I will spend this year studying at Kean University for free as part of a dual-enrollment partnership between APA and Kean. I will receive around 30 credits this year - tuition-free! Although I will not continue to study theatre after high school, APA offered a fantastic opportunity for me to pursue and cultivate my interests.', ""The Academy for Performing arts is a school that is like no other. This advanced educational environment not only pushes it's students to work hard, but to strengthen their talents and passions as well. When thinking about a performing arts high school, many people assume APA is a place that refers to academics as a second priority. However, this is extremely wrong. What I admire most about this high school is how there is an even balance between academics and performing. Dancers and actors have the opportunity to strengthen and perfect their trade over four years,  as well as their minds. Sending seniors to Kean is another aspect of APA that makes it unique. Experiencing college before high school is even over has prepared me and my peers tremendously. I feel ahead of the game and ready to face my future.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I’ve enjoyed my education that I have received from APA, but the community of students makes it hard to enjoy the school.', 'It is filled with great opportunities.

It is very challenging academically, but I feel prepared to go to college thanks to them.', 'I majored in theatre here. My theatre education was excellent, though there was not a great deal of flexibility in exploring outside of my major. This year, I am a senior, and I will spend this year studying at Kean University for free as part of a dual-enrollment partnership between APA and Kean. I will receive around 30 credits this year - tuition-free! Although I will not continue to study theatre after high school, APA offered a fantastic opportunity for me to pursue and cultivate my interests.', ""The Academy for Performing arts is a school that is like no other. This advanced educational environment not only pushes it's students to work hard, but to strengthen their talents and passions as well. When thinking about a performing arts high school, many people assume APA is a place that refers to academics as a second priority. However, this is extremely wrong. What I admire most about this high school is how there is an even balance between academics and performing. Dancers and actors have the opportunity to strengthen and perfect their trade over four years,  as well as their minds. Sending seniors to Kean is another aspect of APA that makes it unique. Experiencing college before high school is even over has prepared me and my peers tremendously. I feel ahead of the game and ready to face my future.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I am currently a senior at the Academy for Performing Arts and these past four years have been amazing.

However, I thought that the teachers ill-prepared me for whats to come (education wise). In terms of ethnicity, it is not as diverse as a public school. The food is not great, so I would recommend bringing your own lunch.', ""If you're looking for a challenge, this school delivers, although not in the way you expect. Teachers obviously choose favorites and the administration does not punish those who cheat their way to the top. Go to a district high school if you want a fair chance of getting into honor societies and a full high school experience. Would only recommend to students who are passionate about the medical field and are certain they want to pursue it in their futures."", ""The community at the Academy is great. Because the school is very small (less than 300 students total) everyone is familiar with each other. The teachers are also very kind and helpful. No teacher will ever deny helping a student, whether it be school work or something extra. The classes are very focused on the biomedical field, and I can honestly say I gained a very thorough exposure to the medical field. One downside to the academy is the sports available. Especially for boys. The school offer co-ed soccer, girls' basketball, and girls' softball. However, they are starting a boys tennis team, and as the school continues to grow, more sports will hopefully be available to the students. Overall, attending the academy was a great experience."", 'This school allowed me to explore the medical field like not other school would let me. It has been a place where memories can be made, new friends can be found, and where you get to learn more about yourself. This school opens your eyes to college life in the sense that it teaches you how to self study rather than to have everything spoon-fed to you which helps you learn how to live in college.', ""After attending this academy for the past four years, I've come to appreciate the college readiness that this school has integrated into my doctrine. Those long nights studying and completing endless assignments were gruesome, but it is with this school I have found my love for the sciences and medical field. The knowledge I have obtained from this school has given me some of the knowledge I need to pursue my path and future as a medical student, and for that I am grateful. I hope to leave this school with my head held high and confidence in high spirits as I leave to take on the real world ahead of me."", ""It is a great school.  The teaching staff is not the best, the rigor of the curriculum really prepares students for college.  This is this particular school's primary selling point.  Sports, clubs, and other ancillary aspects are quite lacking, but I am fond of this school's ability to prepare students for college and a career in the today's dynamic healthcare industry."", 'The Academy was a great experience. The heavy workload and tough subjects, as well as electives focused on the medical field, allows for students to gain more knowledge about the medical field as well as become prepared for their time in college.', 'Teachers are the best part of school :) most are super understanding, always willing to offer extra help, and overall just fun people to be around.', 'What I like about this school is that it is small, and all of the students share a common interest when it comes to achieving their goals. It prepares me for college and life skills.', ""This school is associated with Rutgers and students who complete and pass all of the offered classes can go to Rutgers with over 10 credits. For those interested in pursuing the medical field, this school is an excellent option because it shows you the medical field from a very broad standpoint. One of the downsides of the school however is that many of the students do not get home until 4 or 5 o'clock and this restricts the students ability to participate in extracurricular activities."", 'If you are looking for a school that will prepare you for a career in health care, then Woodbridge Academy is the school for you.

They're either too easy or too difficult, there is no in-between. I wish I'd gone to my regular high school instead of coming here, because I feel like my educational experience would've been better. As a student, you have to be very very very dedicated to medicine straight out as an 8th grader, because the entire curriculum is very science-based, so there is no room to change your mind later on. For me, the experience was not good, but at least this school taught me I am not interested in pursuing medicine later.

But they all do their job well.', ""I chose this school because I know exactly what I want to do with my future: medicine. However, the struggles and mental obstacles I have had to overcome at this school have been quite severe. Although the students are generally very nice and supportive of each other, there is an underlying competitiveness in all of us that wants to beat everyone else to get to where we want to be. Everyday, kids talks about SATs scores and AP tests and GPAs and colleges and medical programs. Everyone is extremely stressed, not even in a good way. There is a detrimental effect on the mental health of teenagers at this school, and it does not culminate a positive atmosphere for teenagers to grow up and positively discover the people that they are going to become. While stress is a normal part of life for high school students everywhere, the amount of stress that students have here is overwhelming. Personally, I feel like I have mental breakdowns from the stress more than is healthy. It's ironic, really, because all of the students come to this school in hopes of becoming physicians or go into the medical profession. This school has classes from Rutgers that have to do with healthcare in place of normal high school electives. Only some of these classes are worth any of the effort it takes to go to this school and are also only worth it if you decide to go to the schools that take the credits for these classes. I don't know if I would choose this school over again if I could. I would definitely choose a vocational school that specializes in medicine, but not this school."", 'I feel like I\'ve only learned from one or two of all of the teachers at this school. Classes that don\'t have to do with medicine or allied health generally do not help you learn and seem like they are only there because it is required by law. Although classes are stated to be ""honors""-level, it certainly does not seem that way. Teachers have a habit of being very biased and not involved in their students\' activities, so come time to ask for letters of recommendation, teachers have no way of distinguishing one student from another based on personal connections and go purely based off of a resume and transcripts. Each teacher has very different ways of grading. One mathematics teacher uses tests and quizzes for 90% of your grade; these are not separate percentages put together, but rather, tests and quizzes are the same thing and weighted the same. Other teachers may have tests only worth 45% of your grade. Teaching does not seem to be adequate for high-school-level learning and often feels like I am back in middle school. Either work given is too rigorous or no work is given at all. Lots of busy work. Teachers also expect too much of the students, which is where personal bias comes into play and lends to favoritism, resulting in some better letters of recommendation and teacher communication to one student versus another. Overall, the quality and standard of teachers hired at this school are not seemingly high enough for a school with a reputation of such high caliber. Student test scores are only high because they all have the drive to succeed and do well, working themselves without help of teachers.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['No one really cares for the extracurriculars at at this school. there is no authority and legit representation of them.', 'My typical and dreamed of high school experience was actually not met at this school. there a lot of things i wish i could have done like i would have at a different school in terms of clubs, extracurriculars and school events.

There were definitely times where I felt like giving up and dropping out of the school, but I learned to survive here. I met so many amazing friends here, people I could understand. One of my favorite experiences was playing basketball. At the school, sports aren't very important. We usually lose most of our games, but the thing is, playing on the team is fun. I loved being part of the team and going to practices. If I could do it all over, I would definitely choose this school again. Although, if I were to do it all over again, I'd try my best starting freshman year, rather than junior year. Sadly, I didn't realize how important it was to not procrastinate until my junior year. Of course, there are some cons to this school. For example, this school is very very competitive. The students always compare themselves to the others, and that makes the school incredibly stressful. But, I do not regret coming to the school, because I have learned so much."", ""Most of the teachers are college professors, and we also have a nurse and a trauma surgeon, as well as an engineer that has worked for NASA. That being said, all of our teachers are very knowledgeable in what they teach. On the other hand, however, some of them aren't approachable, and some don't teach well at all. Overall, I feel that this school is mainly self study. The most important skill you learn here is how to self study, because some teachers do not teach."", ""My school, The Academy for Allied Health and Biomedical Sciences, is a school in which students must apply and interview to get in. After the application process, only about 70 students are accepted. This school has been the most interesting, unique experience of my life. With a predominantly Indian population, the culture of the school flourishes. Being a white Catholic male, I had never experienced such new fetes until attending my school. Aside from the culture shock, my school is extremely competitive academically. I love this school for preparing me for college yet sometimes I do not know if colleges understand the difference of my school from others. I worry colleges only see me as an average 3.4 GPA student, rather than an extremely hard working person taking all college-based classes. If I had the choice go back and go to a different school, I would not. The humbling experience of not flying by high-school with straight A's has taught me a lot, and I truly appreciate it."", ""The school is okay. I met some of my best friends there because we all had similar interests. With a small student body, it's easier to become cliquey after a few years. Lots of drama between friends and lots of rumors. The name doesn't really help with getting into colleges. Many unique medical courses with lots of different and new labs, however, will not recommend over a larger school with more APs, extracurriculars, and more opportunities in general. If you change your mind about whether you want to pursue medicine while in this school, it will not help you with colleges at all."", 'It helped me become a stronger person, through challenges and tough college style teaching.

There are cliques, like at every high school, but these cliques are malleable and everyone honestly meshes with each other within and between grades. \r We learn biology and anatomy that most med students learn in their later undergrad or earlier grad years.

Everyone is competitive, sometimes overly-so, but there are a lot of helpful people who want to see you succeed. If I had to choose to come here again, I probably would have. And a key piece of advice is do NOT procrastinate! I can't stress this enough because every time I say this, nobody listens. Then they complain that this school takes up too much time and effort.

Even though I am new to the school but throughout the first few weeks I can feel that it's a great school. Teacher are nice and professional, as well as my peers.

There are people who end even later due to musical and production rehearsals. There are a handful of teachers who know what they're doing. The bathrooms are very dirty, lots of roaches. The hallways are pretty dark too. The music program I am in is okay, could be more. I don't find anything too special about the school, like everyone keeps saying.

I have always struggled with math, she picked me back up when I wasn't confident in my skills regarding math. My photography teacher, she had taught me to inspire others and go for what I want in life. I am so happy that they were wonderful influences on me. They both were an inspiration to me.

The teachers and staff at North Shore genuinely care about their students and want to see them succeed. Whenever a student needs help or assistance, it is right there waiting for her. Additionally, there are many clubs, sports, and extracurricular activities that students are not only told about but encouraged to take part in. I felt extremely prepared for college and attribute that readiness to North Shore's resources and curriculum!"", ""North Shore is a lot of things. I can speak to the IB program as I was a candidate my junior and senior year. Many of the teachers are well-trained in IB, but I think the shift from AP to IB is still in process. Generally speaking, all of my teachers are helpful to an extent, some will go out of their way to help you, others will not (really depends on the subject and/or teacher). Other than the IB program, most of my teachers were poor to average. The resources are meh...when applying for college YOU need to reach out, guidance counselors may help a little, but the heavy lifting is on you. Needless to say, North Shore isn't all bad. Although the administration is almost impossible to contact/nothing will come from it, I feel ready for college and the challenges it will bring.

However, there is a lack of diversity in the school district.', ""I feel pressured to do my best the entire time here. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I never get enough time to sleep and still be able to do well of my tests the next day. Not enough different level course choices, and the IB program is too limiting. I take all IB classes (no diploma) and I just feel like it's a constant routine. I am not allowed to have lunch if I want to take music and visual art, so I have to eat in certain classes or bring snacks for the whole day"", 'After my four years attending North Shore High School, I can say that I have had a very pleasurable experience. I have made lasting relationships with many of my fellow students, as well as the staff who have made my transitions throughout the years much easier.', ""My experience has been amazing. I took advantage of everything my school offered and I have excelled in so many aspects.

We think similarly; we act similarly - maybe even too similarly. One of the major flaws I feel as I look on my time as a high schooler is having nearly non-existent experience with non-white students inside and outside the classroom. Transitioning to the IB program was a good decision - for the workload of IA’s and other essays - I feel - prepared me for the more concenptual and long term work of higher education. But, many courses are inferior to their AP counterparts. For example, in my experience, Biology and notably the humanities are inferior to their corresponding AP program - at least in the first of their two years.', 'I have greatly enjoyed my experience at North Shore. The school has great teachers who are very understanding. Myself, I have a digestive disease and my school has helped me through all of the days I miss.', 'too much crack these kids be juuling all day every day. unsafe too many pods. too much nic. juul chargers are not provided.', ""Great, loved everything about it.

Overall, I will miss my favorite teachers. My math teacher had taught me that math, even though it is hard, it is great to accomplish something that you struggle with. I have always struggled with math, she picked me back up when I wasn't confident in my skills regarding math. My photography teacher, she had taught me to inspire others and go for what I want in life. I am so happy that they were wonderful influences on me. They both were an inspiration to me.

I felt extremely prepared for college and attribute that readiness to North Shore's resources and curriculum!"", ""North Shore is a lot of things. I can speak to the IB program as I was a candidate my junior and senior year. Many of the teachers are well-trained in IB, but I think the shift from AP to IB is still in process. Generally speaking, all of my teachers are helpful to an extent, some will go out of their way to help you, others will not (really depends on the subject and/or teacher). Other than the IB program, most of my teachers were poor to average. The resources are meh...when applying for college YOU need to reach out, guidance counselors may help a little, but the heavy lifting is on you. Needless to say, North Shore isn't all bad. Although the administration is almost impossible to contact/nothing will come from it, I feel ready for college and the challenges it will bring. I guess I enjoyed North Shore, but it was too difficult/exhausting at times. Again, I took the IB so I am biased!!"", 'North Shore Schools is a spectacular place to receive an education.

However, there is a lack of diversity in the school district.', ""I feel pressured to do my best the entire time here. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I never get enough time to sleep and still be able to do well of my tests the next day. Not enough different level course choices, and the IB program is too limiting. I take all IB classes (no diploma) and I just feel like it's a constant routine. I am not allowed to have lunch if I want to take music and visual art, so I have to eat in certain classes or bring snacks for the whole day"", 'After my four years attending North Shore High School, I can say that I have had a very pleasurable experience.

In each subject, there are several A.P. courses, electives, and college now courses available to students. Students also get to choose their schedules rather than having uninteresting classes forced upon them. Contrastingly, the school can work on extra-curricular activities and sports availability. Students faced a very difficult time trying to instill new sports teams for the school, and most attempts were unsuccessful. The blame would have to fall on the school’s administration in the case. However, there are no doubts that Goldstein has high potential to solve these problems in the future. More extra-curriculars and sports teams encourage students to be more involved in their schooling, and helps to improve grades in order to participate in these events.', 'This school is great for preparing students for the college environment as long as one is willing to study, work hard, and strive for good grades. The environment is relaxed, and the teachers are willing to help out if one asks for advice or any particular question.

If you are willing to learn and do your assignments, it will prepare you for college. Teachers are patient and willing to go the extra mile for any dedicated student. Do not be afraid and ask any questions that come into your mind, they will be willing to answer.  Don't even get me start on describing the beauty of the school's campus. Since it is on KCC campus, the ambiance and security is top notch. You will definitely enjoy your four years there."", ""Teachers can be a mixed bag. History and English teachers are fun, engaging and innovative and prepared me for college, while, the majority of Math and Science teachers fell short. The administration has some pearls but most are rocks. Counseling for both classes and college are mediocre. The school isn't very diverse. The school slashed it's arts program which used to be vibrant and colorful. It is in a beautiful building/campus and you feel really safe. It feels like a suburban school with the luxuries of New York City. At the end of the day, the school is what you make of it."", 'Leon M. Goldstein is a wonderful school where I feel comfortable being myself. I feel challenged in the academic realm and I feel the need to succeed within every aspect of the learning community. School activities bring every one together and it gives the school atmosphere a great place to make friends that share similar interests.

Hillsborough High School,"['Hillsborough High School offers many different types of programs which is beneficial to its students. Many of the teachers are very good. They teach students in an efficient manner and do their best to help students comprehend the material at hand. Some downsides are the fees that were put in due to budget cuts which sometimes hinders students to participate in certain extracurricular or sports of their choosing.  In addition, the facilities are not the best as some things are broken and certain classrooms tend to be crowded due to budget cuts. Overall it is an above average environment and gives me ample learning opportunities.', 'I loved Hillsborough because it gave me the opportunity to explore who I am personally and academically. It gave me so many options to create myself and build my character.', 'Solid academics, but courses are typically very challenging. Teachers vary, some are great and some are poor.', ""Although HHS is academically over the top, the culture of the school itself brings the rating down significantly. Hillsborough Township Public Schools District no longer has funds to do anything. You have to pay a significant amount of money to be in any clubs, to get bussing and to play sports. That is absurd!Overall, it can't be rated more than an average school."", 'I think Hillsborough High School is a very good school to attend.  Most of the teachers are great and the classes are fun.  One thing I really like is that I can build up a connection with most of my teachers as the school year progresses which I feel helps me get through the year and makes it more enjoyable.  The school also offers several fun dances, such as homecoming and prom, themed school football games, many sports, tons of clubs, and a fun night called spirit night where each of the four grades is teamed together against the other grades and tries to win in various activities of the night and throughout the year.  One thing I would change is that the district recently passed a referendum which cut a lot of spending.  This has made everything at the school super expensive.', 'Hillsborough High School has a lot of great educational programs and concentrations to help you think about a major for college, and there are some really nice teachers. The office policies are not very clear all the time and it can be difficult to get help when planning for college specifics. Other than that, this is a great school to attend.', 'Hillsborough High school is a very average school it has given me a good foundation to start at and I like the diversity it has although the building is not the nicest the employees are very nice.', 'This town is going down the drain. Overcrowding, teacher and budget cuts, athlete prioritization and awful food are some of the examples.', 'Some teachers were great and really made sure students understood the material, but a fair amount of teachers were could absolutely not have cared less about whether the students were responsive to their teaching methods.', 'Hillsborough High School offers many sports, clubs, and activities for different grades and interests. There are also lots of courses and electives available to further your education in specific subjects and possible majors students are interested in.', ""Hillsborough High School is a place where you can do well if you're independent. Various learning styles are not explored and at no point did I feel that faculty was willing to reform teaching methods for those were incompatible with their styles of instruction. I fared well as somebody who can learn on her own but ultimately, there was minimal development in the way I learned and studied."", 'The experience at the High school was really nice. The curriculum was at a good pace. The counselors were very helpful with helping me get where I need to be. I wish there would have been more opportunities to do activities as a school.', 'HHS is a great place to complete your primary education. In general the main draw for HHS is the academics and well regarded faculty that allow you to learn.  Students who chose to take a large amount of honors or AP classes might find themselves stressed out as the difference between unweighted and honors and AP classes in terms of difficulty is immense due to the teachers teaching the higher level courses. This truly prepares you for college, and a friendly and helpful guidance staff makes the transition from apply to deciding on a college seamless. The school infrastructure is becoming dated and rooms with no heat or air conditioning is common. Lunch food is what you would expect, it is a good idea to bring your own lunch. Clubs are plentiful and there is no excuse to not have anything to do after school is over. The school also supports an NHS chapter which I was a part off and keep you involved.', 'I really enjoyed the opportunities I had to take honors and AP courses throughout my high school career, and I had many teachers that changed my education experience for the better.', 'I love Hillsborough High School! You meet people you never thought that you’ll meet plus theirs plenty of teachers that care for you. None of the guidance counselors want to see you fail. Everyone last one of my teachers pushed me to my best potential I don’t think I could’ve found anything else like that at any other school.', ""The school itself has amazing teachers who really do care about their students and their education. However, like every place there are downsides. Sometimes the school wouldn't take action on a certain issue and there would still be ongoing issues months after."", 'I believe this school is good, but there are some areas that need improvement. I think more focus needs to be put on the individual student’s health and confidence as high school can have a lot factors influencing student’s lives.', 'I like meeting new people and being able to get chrome books for learning. There are a variety of classes and courses to take, which is nice. The school isn’t that big so it’s easy to find your way around. However, the food, bathrooms, locker rooms, heating and cooling, and cleanliness of the school is very poor compared to others. The teachers could be nicer and the curriculum kind of sucks.

Unfortunately many teachers are not the best teachers.  For me, I was able to have those teachers that were actually good at teaching.  Many of my friends did not have the same opportunities as I had.  The open campus is strange for a school in the middle of New Jersey.

There's many heavy, main courses but also a myriad of fun extracurricular classes and the requirements for graduation at this school make it easy to meet college requirements without having to worry about it since freshman year. The most unique thing about this school is the way it's laid out. Classes are grouped by subject into buildings and we have 10 different buildings, similar to a college campus."", 'Teachers are generally ok. The issue is that very few can teach effectively. Some of the AP teachers are very educated but they lack the skills to pass on that education. Most teachers enjoy their subject. They tend to be consistant throughout the year but grading varies from teacher to teacher. Most go different routes in their teaching.', 'The extracirriculars at BRHS are of the highest standard. There is a club and activity for everyone, and enthusiastic and helpful teachers and student leaders at the head of these clubs. Everyone can fit in when they find the club of their choosing.', ""I have really enjoyed by 3 years here at Bridgewater Raritan. I like the teaching staff and I've made great connections with a few teachers that have really extended beyond teacher into more of a mentor figure. I love sports at BRHS, I'm president of the varsity club and a captain of the swim team and I love how strong our school is in other sports, winning at least one state title in any given sport per year. There are lots of people at this school and they're in the most part friendly and willing to talk or be friends with anyone willing to to reciprocate kindness.

People are passionate about their extracurriculars here and that shows in our school's success in various fields."", 'Teachers at BRHS are generally very knowledgeable and successful at allowing students to have a good grasp on the material. Obviously not every single teacher is the best of the best but I feel that as a whole, the teaching staff is excellent, one of the best in New Jersey and will help you have a successful time in their class if you are willing to put in the effort. Most of the teachers I have had really respect hard workers and will devote a lot of their time to helping you if they see you putting in effort, even if you struggle with the material. In general, the teachers are approachable, helpful, and competent at Bridgewater-Raritan High School.', 'Lots of ways to get involved! The sports are awesome, we have almost every sport. Lots of clubs for all interests, hobbies, languages, etc. there are also many ways to do community service in clubs. The clubs can make a well rounded student.', ""The school has a high standard it likes to meet. I have learned a lot and met a large variety of people here that I won't forget.

The science department is very good. Most teachers have a high degree in science. These science teachers teach more than the curriculum says to teach.

There are so many classes to choose from and so many helpful advisors and teachers to help you along the way.

Most of the staff is helpful and good teachers, although there can be some teachers who don’t teach or aren’t as nice/ good at teaching. It offers many programs and clubs and you could always create your own club, but it is still also lacking in some areas such as film.', 'Both my children went to Calhoun and each had different interest, one in Theatre, one in Sports.  Calhoun equally supports the Arts programs as they do the Sports programs.  And the academics are even stronger!  Principal Nicole Hollings is the heart and soul of Calhoun!', 'The community at Calhoun is very warm and inviting. Everyone is committed to Calhoun, whether is be through sports or clubs or music. School spirit is undeniable at Calhoun, everyone has a Calhoun shirt on any day of the week.', 'Good high school, lots of activities good teachers. I love this high school and hope my kids will go here some day', 'I would like to see a better guidance department and a better informed student populace. There was too much of an emphasis on buzzwords like ""safe spaces"" ""individuality"" and feelings. However, there were great programs for drama and science research.', 'The students and teachers there were so much nicer than my last school, Sachem North. Everyone seemed to care about each other.', 'I would like to see more AP courses available. Also guidance counselors push students to take certain classes which is nice, but they push too far sometimes.', ""I love all the teachers there. They really care about you not just as a student but as a person. The administration could handle things better in terms of bullying, sexual harassment and things of that nature. There's not much diversity which can cause problems and while Calhoun says they're open minded in terms of things related to the LGBTQA+ Community the administration has a long way to go in relation to being accommodating and giving equal treatment to those students. But hey, they have a good performing arts program though right?"", 'My time at Calhoun HS will be one I will never forget. I have learned so much. With the help and guidance of my parents and the faculty I have matured so much academically and personally. I have participated in varsity soccer, varsity badminton, DECA and written for the school newspaper. These wonderful experiences I will take with me for a lifetime. Some of the classes I have taken were very challenging, I have learned to how to study better and organize better so that I was able to meet these challenges. Thanks to my time at Calhoun HS I feel that I am prepared for the next phase of my life. I am looking forward to going to college and experiencing all that it has to offer.', 'Being a part of the Sanford H. Calhoun environment has been fantastic. The arts program here is amazing. The willingness of the administration to accept a music program like the one that we have here is just unbelievable. For me the only real problem that l’ve  faced in Calhoun is the lack of diversity and coming together. Yes, we have clubs that bring people with different ethnicities together ,but we always confine ourselves to our own friend groups and people with similar ethnicities.

With every club imaginable, different sports and elective courses , one is able to achieve anything they strive for. However, sometimes having a large schools isn’t as beneficial for students. Most sports are incredibly competitive and therefore hard to get into, limiting students top potential. On the other hand, there are tons of clubs that each student is welcome to join which makes up for the sports. Although the schools offers tons of electives from AP to honors and life-learning skill electives (Ex. Culinary arts) I feel as though it lacks electives focused on the medical field. There are tons of electives that are related to law but other than AP biology and AP chemistry there aren’t much on medical field specifically.', ""My experience at WHRHS has been a good one.

The main reasoning being the social scene. The school was extremely cliquey.

People are very friendly. My daughter made good friends and has improved  academically every year.', 'Watchung Hills is above average in both size and quality. Housing around 2000 students, the school comes with many of the ups and downs this brings. On the ups side, the opportunities present are extremely varied, with a slew of elective classes to choose from along with extremely diverse clubs and activities. However, on the downside of things, the sheer size of Watchung Hills makes social life more of a challenge. This inevitably causes cliques to form, a system that also has its own benefits and downsides. In regards to sports and clubs, sports in particular are often fairly tight knit and make for a good way to make new friends. Clubs, however, meet less frequently and for a shorter period of time than sports in most cases, and are less effective at achieving this. Despite that, the sheer volume of clubs is quiet impressive.', 'The education within Watchung Hills Regional High School is why I am extremely grateful to attend this school. For example, I have not only learned an immense amount of important history from my three years of taking history class, I also learned about the human condition and many life lessons because of my phenomenal teachers within the history wing. Many of the teachers wishing Watchung Hills truly care about their students, and it shows. In addition, I have immersed myself within the theatre arts area of the school, and have learned more about myself as an artist. Because of the many music and arts courses I have taken, I know that I will continue the arts in my college pursuits.', 'The academics at this school are unnecessarily hard. I know students who have graduated who come back and tell me that our high school over-prepares us. For example, one of my friends has 126 in one of his classes in college but his GPA in high school was below a 3.0. This might look like an advantage, but it honestly shouldn\'t be considered as one. Students are overworked and are always stressed out. There are times when we have to pull all-nighters due to the unnecessary workload that is given. Students who have low GPAs aren\'t actually dumb or don\'t work hard. It\'s just that the school is hard. With the level of difficulty, the school has a ""no extra-credit"" policy, which is what makes it even worse. This makes a lot of the students look bad when they apply to colleges, but they\'re really not,  which is the sad part.', 'Not only does the school place a strong emphasis on safety, the general supportive atmosphere in the school makes it a suitable learning environment.', 'Loved that there was a a wide variety of electives to choose from.

The school is really big and has a lot of great clubs to get involved in so be sure to explore all your options and get involved because you won’t regret it and you will make some great friends along the way! The only bad thing about the school is the administration just because of all the politics and how people at the top are always trying to take away students freedoms just to make the school look better to the public.

Compared to a lot of other schools nationwide or even in the area, it is very advanced and prepares you well for college. While the administration can be hard to work with, most teachers are nice. I've had a number of teachers who've really inspired me, been kind to me, and definitely influenced my direction in life. (The history department in particular.) Yes, there is plenty of drama and fights over trivial things, but you'll find that at any school. As a senior, my best advice is to take advantage of all the school offers. Be it clubs, sports, extra help...take advantage of it, and immerse yourself in the culture. You'll get teachers you hate or courses you hate, or have to deal with seemingly incompetent administrators, but in the end, the good memories outweigh the bad. Have fun, apply yourself in class and extracurriculars, and thank those teachers that go above and beyond to help you learn. If you do, Watchung Hills will serve you well."", ""As a student here, I have a slightly biased view and, like all high schoolers,  I can't wait to leave.

It is important to be somewhat self motivated to make sure you get the most out of everything offered here.', 'I enjoyed the number of engineering classes offered.  Classes such as intro to engineering design, principles of engineering, and civil engineering and architecture really allowed me to explore engineering and fostered a love for engineering.  These classes led me to major in engineering in college.', 'Watchung Hills Regional is an amazing school overall. With so many electives and a range of academic classes there is always a place for any student to fit in and find their niche.', ""Currently a senior at Watchung Hills, I've seen everything. Good and bad. Watchung Hills is a very great school, academically. The students are ambitious, the athletes are motivated, and the teachers truly love their jobs. The school has an ambundous of resources such as technology, art supplies, instruments, biology tools, etc. Overall, there are no major accounts of issues regarding bullying or physical fights. However, one criticism. There is no diversity. It is a very caucasian dominant school, and students here have a very closed-off mindset. I feel as though most students are not very educated about people not like themselves, and therefore don't know how to act around certain minorities.  I have witnessed racial slurs, mostly behind people's backs, and felt very uncomfortable. The worst part of all, administration is not aware nor informed of occurrences like these, therefore there is no action against stopping this.
