There were really no dietary accommodations for the students.', ""The principal tried to be as involved as he could. The guidance counselor always tried to help but only when the students came to her. The office staff was okay, there wasn't very many of them. The policies on bullying were that it would not be tolerated at all but it wasn't always enforced heavily. The dress code was strict, you had to wear the uniform. "", ""Most of the teachers truly care about their students and want to help the because they know that they come from a poor background. The teaching styles were average, nothing extravagant but enough to challenge the students a little more every day. Most teachers had very good knowledge on their subject but a very select few had trouble making the students understand it. They were pretty consistent with grades, if you didn't put effort into it, a bad grade. If you did put a lot of effort into it, a good grade. "", ""there weren't many kids involved in sports at this school, the only sport offered was basketball which only had a few members on the team. The team played okay but didn't have the motivation to do very well so they lost most games. Barely anyone went to the basketball games except for a select few that were close to the players. The athletic facilities weren't very good or big for that matter, the fitness programs were of poor quality. "", 'There were a few clubs at the school but not everyone joined them, usually it was only the most intelligent kids at school that did so. Depending on the club, if it was an academic club with all of the most intelligent students then most kids would be committed, but other clubs like for the performing arts some would stop attending meetings until eventually the club became nonexistent. ', ""There was a lot of bullying but only towards certain kids. You were safe only if you hadn't made a problem with the ghetto kids or the gangs at the school. There were no special security measures until someone got stabbed and then they decided to put metal detectors but only for 3 days. The school nurse was somewhat helpful. We didn't really have any health programs or services. The school was pretty safe, the teachers and principal kept a pretty close eye on the students to keep them from getting into fights. "", ""There wasn't a high level of student involvement. There was a lot of peer pressure to do the wrong thing but the smartest of the kids never fell for it. Of course there were those people who spoke badly of people of other sexual orientations or religions, but not everyone did it, just a select few. Also, many of those who did only spoke that way because of their ignorance towards the subject. No one at the school was really racist at all, and most of the school consisted of blacks and hispanics, with a very small population of white students and asian students but no one treated them in a racist manner.

Also some of the teacher hired see teaching as a job rather than a career. Some teacher job end at 4:00 and you will not hear from them until 8:00 am the next day.

From yearbook committee, to debate, to Tiara club everyone is infatuated with calling their club ""The best"". I too am guilty of doing so because the club I partake in in my opinion is the best of the best.  I have been apart of the Debate team for four years now. Our club does not just stop at the school. We travel to Princeton University for One-Day Debate Conventons, Parsippany, Woodbridge and the farthest and longest convention we have been to is the three day convention in Washington D.C. The Junior Statesman of America is the debate team organization we partake in which is not a cheap one AT all. We do seek administrative help which then assists us with transportation and funds needed to pay additional expenses that we could not cover from fundraising alone. I use this example to prove the support of the administration for any club or organization. Fundraising does include our own, but we do get help from the Board.

Also some of the teacher hired see teaching as a job rather than a career. Some teacher job end at 4:00 and you will not hear from them until 8:00 am the next day. You have to make the teachers work rather than having the teachers make the students work. Also another con about the school is it is too small. Walmart is bigger than PAAAS.

This is also a project-based school, so while we don't take tests regularly, A LOT of our time is spent writing papers.  Another thing to add; there are no letter grades. Instead, there are standards like Honors, Exceeds, Meets, Approaching, and Incomplete.

Just make sure you put in the effort into your classes and you are good to go.', ""The community found at Repertory Company High School is, by far, the closest thing to a family a student can experience outside of their own home!The seemingly 'unconventional' high school environment that comes with the territory of being located in 42nd/Times Square and in the building of Town Hall allows students to learn of independence and initiative, as well as the diversity and very flourishing culture of NYC. This school is equipped to educate and train those that are serious about pursuing the arts as a career after graduating and inspire those that are just curious or interested in the concept of performing. The possibilities here are truly endless and the best part is that there are no restrictions or limitations put on students as they travel on their own artistic journey."", ""It is an incredible school and it was the best choice i made to audition and go there. It has been a blessing to be part of all the events and get all the opportunities that I've gotten while being there. The teachers and staff have been incredibly helpful with planning my future and making sure i stay on top of my grades."", ""What I loved about Repertory was its size. It's small size allows for close relationships to be made not only between students but also between teachers and students. I also loved the theatre program and how there is a piece of theatre for everyone: backstage, onstage, dance, acting, singing, writing, producing, directing, etc. However, Repertory can work on its academics, including teachers and supplies. Teachers are in and out, and the school struggles to find teachers to stay as a teacher for one class, leaving the students at a disadvantage. The school right now doesn't have working laptops for all the students. Though there are a lot of physical laptops, they are almost always broken, dead with no charger, missing keys, not connecting to the internet, etc."", 'I love how close the community of the school is, since there is about 260 students overall, it doesn’t feel like your typical judge school.', 'I love the people in the school and the family oriented.

I expected the high school musical experience. It’s actually like any other school. I wish I would have put myself out more or engaged in more because that’s how you get further than others performance wise. There are upgrades needed equipment wise such as computers that actually work.', 'During my time at Repertory I learned that there really is such a thing as a home away from home.

The teachers care deeply for the students especially since it’s a small school. I really like it here.', ""As a graduating senior of the Class of 2018 at Repertory, my experience has been unique. The school offers many performing arts opportunities outside of school. Also there are a vast amount of organizations that covers the vast amount of interests shown by students. My junior year, I was able to partake in a after school paid internship at the Park Avenue Armory. On the contray, the school lacks organization skills. In addition the communication amongst the staff is poor.  For example, one teacher may plan a mid day trip and other teachers wouldn't be aware."", 'I like that this high school gave us a chance to experience all 3 arts and did not make us as students stick to one choice', ""The students are really welcoming, and although there are friend groups, the atmosphere is pretty open so it's very easy to be included. Most teachers are good, and get the lessons across with the exception of a few teachers. Saftey wise there are no metal detectors and were located near Time Square so there's a lot of foot traffic."", 'Repertory is a great school filled with a diverse group of students and staff. Its a small school so the class sizes are smaller, and teachers become more personal and welcoming than any other schools. The school is art based, so performing classes (acting, dancing, singing) are mandatory. They have great connections with groups and organizations based in the arts which help students in and out of school.', 'My class of 2018 has been like a family. Regardless of the problems we had with each other, we have proved to be there for each other when we needed it the most, especially when someone wanted to attack one of our own for petty reasons. We know who we are, and we embrace our differences because the one thing we have in common is the dream to go far in life and are proud of our roots.  What I would change is the way students interact with different teachers because I believe that a respectful relationship should be enforced by the students and teachers. I think it is disrespectful and unfair for students to respect one teacher more than another, just because one can be more ""strict"" and have a more demanding tone then another one does. We all go to school to learn and when your peers disrupt one particular class daily, it gets you frustrated because the material is not being taught, nor understood.', ""Repertory has always been a fun school that encourages students to express themselves and be diverse and honest. I've always loved the school because of the school environment and the opportunities given to students. I wish the staff would speak more on diversity and teach more about real life things like taxes, APR rates, and general things that students leave high school not knowing."", ""Throughout my 4 years of attending Repertory, I can say I've grown exponentially in both academic and Performing Arts Fields. The school's small size allows it to pay attention to students and give them all opportunities that come from their partnerships with the many nearby features and companies. I was able to do things like win scholarships for dance intensives, perform on broadway stages, and even fully direct a play of my writing. Where else can you do all of that?"", ""As a Freshman at Rep, I love it here.There is no bullying. Everyone at Repis the sweetest and really care about your success and happiness. Our administration is very dedicated to well being of the students. We are a small school so everyone knows everyone and it makes life great because you don't feel like a little fish in a big sea you feel like you're equally cared about."", 'I am really proud to be apart of this school. This school has a lot to offer in the arts, all of them from dance, singing, and acting. Throughout the years all 3 of the arts was implemented in my schedule and I love every one of the classes. In dance class, we would learn everything from jazz to musical theater and even to ballet. In the acting category, there are 2 plays every year, one would be a musical and the other would be a play. The shows are all student auditioned and performed.

Just make sure you put in the effort into your classes and you are good to go.', ""The community found at Repertory Company High School is, by far, the closest thing to a family a student can experience outside of their own home!The seemingly 'unconventional' high school environment that comes with the territory of being located in 42nd/Times Square and in the building of Town Hall allows students to learn of independence and initiative, as well as the diversity and very flourishing culture of NYC. This school is equipped to educate and train those that are serious about pursuing the arts as a career after graduating and inspire those that are just curious or interested in the concept of performing. The possibilities here are truly endless and the best part is that there are no restrictions or limitations put on students as they travel on their own artistic journey."", ""It is an incredible school and it was the best choice i made to audition and go there. It has been a blessing to be part of all the events and get all the opportunities that I've gotten while being there. The teachers and staff have been incredibly helpful with planning my future and making sure i stay on top of my grades."", ""What I loved about Repertory was its size. It's small size allows for close relationships to be made not only between students but also between teachers and students. I also loved the theatre program and how there is a piece of theatre for everyone: backstage, onstage, dance, acting, singing, writing, producing, directing, etc. However, Repertory can work on its academics, including teachers and supplies. Teachers are in and out, and the school struggles to find teachers to stay as a teacher for one class, leaving the students at a disadvantage. The school right now doesn't have working laptops for all the students. Though there are a lot of physical laptops, they are almost always broken, dead with no charger, missing keys, not connecting to the internet, etc."", 'I love how close the community of the school is, since there is about 260 students overall, it doesn’t feel like your typical judge school.', 'I love the people in the school and the family oriented.

At Rep, every face has a name making your time there that much more comfortable. Teachers and staff are people who want to be there and care about your education. Most importantly, being a student at Rep is about expressing yourself and becoming the person you were made to be.', ""The school is pretty good. They have a good curriculum, it's just mainly the students that could be better.  Would recommend if you want challenging AP classes, and advance classes for the arts  are offered as well."", 'Repertory Company High School has an outstanding theatre department and an excellent academic department. The teachers care deeply for the students especially since it’s a small school. I really like it here.', ""As a graduating senior of the Class of 2018 at Repertory, my experience has been unique. The school offers many performing arts opportunities outside of school. Also there are a vast amount of organizations that covers the vast amount of interests shown by students. My junior year, I was able to partake in a after school paid internship at the Park Avenue Armory. On the contray, the school lacks organization skills. In addition the communication amongst the staff is poor.  For example, one teacher may plan a mid day trip and other teachers wouldn't be aware."", 'I like that this high school gave us a chance to experience all 3 arts and did not make us as students stick to one choice', ""The students are really welcoming, and although there are friend groups, the atmosphere is pretty open so it's very easy to be included. Most teachers are good, and get the lessons across with the exception of a few teachers. Saftey wise there are no metal detectors and were located near Time Square so there's a lot of foot traffic."", 'Repertory is a great school filled with a diverse group of students and staff. Its a small school so the class sizes are smaller, and teachers become more personal and welcoming than any other schools. The school is art based, so performing classes (acting, dancing, singing) are mandatory. They have great connections with groups and organizations based in the arts which help students in and out of school.', 'My class of 2018 has been like a family. Regardless of the problems we had with each other, we have proved to be there for each other when we needed it the most, especially when someone wanted to attack one of our own for petty reasons. We know who we are, and we embrace our differences because the one thing we have in common is the dream to go far in life and are proud of our roots.  What I would change is the way students interact with different teachers because I believe that a respectful relationship should be enforced by the students and teachers. I think it is disrespectful and unfair for students to respect one teacher more than another, just because one can be more ""strict"" and have a more demanding tone then another one does. We all go to school to learn and when your peers disrupt one particular class daily, it gets you frustrated because the material is not being taught, nor understood.', ""Repertory has always been a fun school that encourages students to express themselves and be diverse and honest. I've always loved the school because of the school environment and the opportunities given to students. I wish the staff would speak more on diversity and teach more about real life things like taxes, APR rates, and general things that students leave high school not knowing."", ""Throughout my 4 years of attending Repertory, I can say I've grown exponentially in both academic and Performing Arts Fields. The school's small size allows it to pay attention to students and give them all opportunities that come from their partnerships with the many nearby features and companies. I was able to do things like win scholarships for dance intensives, perform on broadway stages, and even fully direct a play of my writing. Where else can you do all of that?"", ""As a Freshman at Rep, I love it here.There is no bullying. Everyone at Repis the sweetest and really care about your success and happiness. Our administration is very dedicated to well being of the students. We are a small school so everyone knows everyone and it makes life great because you don't feel like a little fish in a big sea you feel like you're equally cared about."", 'I am really proud to be apart of this school. This school has a lot to offer in the arts, all of them from dance, singing, and acting. Throughout the years all 3 of the arts was implemented in my schedule and I love every one of the classes. In dance class, we would learn everything from jazz to musical theater and even to ballet. In the acting category, there are 2 plays every year, one would be a musical and the other would be a play.

Ace is inside South shore educational campus which is a big campus & used to be a whole school & have a lot of students but closed in 2010 due to gang violence, poor academic performance & an array of other things, so New York city decided to open up 7 smaller schools inside. This makes Ace feel like a forgotten school. There's around 200 students & it feels smaller than that due to spotty attendance from a lot of students so most of the time the school feels very empty & not like high school at all.

The small population size makes it easier to create a community and get to know one another.

Not only are the younger students supported by the older students, but also the older students are supported by the teachers who push for college ready scores. The school has limited space, but does well with making ALOT of clubs and making space for newer ones as well. From its top class dance studio to the prestigious science lab, it has something for everyone. Although, to be honest the shared building with the elementary school is the only thing that troubles me. I feel that if only this school had its own building it would be able to thrive even more.

Hudson Staff is very Different and Out going and Optimistic."", ""The school safety staff are everywhere, ready for anything coming their way.

Dreamyard Preparatory School,"['As a high school senior at Dreamyard Preparatory High School, I really admit that this school is a one of the great art schools in the Bronx. Throughout my  entire high school year, I gained a lot of experience such as communications skills and the ability to be independent. One thing I admire about this school is that it really encourages individuals and students to be able to express their thoughts and be open minded as possible. I honestly think this school is a great fit for any individual who is trying to broaden their skills and be successful.', 'What i like the most about Dream yard, is the diversity and the different backgrounds that staff, teacher, faculties and students bring to the environment.', 'I believe that DreamYard is an amazing school for students who want to find themselves and explore more about their likes and dislikes. For instance, if you’re an artist or interested in art, whether it’s dance, theater, music or visual art, students would learn to excel in each category, due to the fun loving and extremely experienced teacher. However, if you’re interested in things non- art related, there are clubs that are student driven, such as Anime Club, Mouse Squad,  Bowling Club, Video Club, Cheerleading clubs and much more.  This school is mainly into arts, but many of the clubs mentioned are very inclusive. Although, when it comes to the academic side, there are many classes with supportive teachers who push you every day to do your best.  Also, we now have AP FOR ALL!!  Therefore, this would be the perfect school for anyone who wants to access their creativity side and take rigorous courses to be LIFE- READY!!', 'My Experience in Dreamyard wasn’t the best but they are very supportive. If your really into Art Dreamyard is the best choice.', 'I like how the community feels very close and how the teachers build a close relationship with students in order to know how to help them get better. There is also no separation between grades, so everyone socializes with everyone. One thing I would like to see change is a cleaner space, like the bathrooms.', 'Dreamyard Preparatory School is an amazing high school located in Bronx, NY. Dreamyard is a performing arts school that exposes theater, musical theater, dance, art and music to its students. They have annual plays that are exceptional, moving and wonderful. Last year was The Lion King and I heard that for the 2017 year it would be Rent. Overall it is a wonderful school that has a very supporitive environment and I would reccomend this school to anyone who wants to learn in a judge free zone.', ""Dreamyard at first was annoying I didn't like it but as time went on I met some amazing people and friends. Dreamyard is the school to go to."", ""Dreamyard Prep is a great school that has many opportunities. I am currently a High School senior at this school and the teachers and students here have made me feel like i'm apart of a family. I really love the way the curriculum is taught at this school. When I graduate, I know I'm going to be prepared for college."", ""There's a ton of different clubs and if you don't like any of them. You can create your own."", 'It was the four years of my life! I freaking loved this high school!', 'Dreamyard Prepatory high school is very safe. We even include our security agents in school wide community building events, we a truly here to learn from each other.', 'Dreamyard Preparory School allows the opportunity for students to create different clubs that may not be available. For example, I participate in Book Club, Mouse Squad, and even had an Mosic Club that the students started. Ofcourse there are more but these are the clubs I know most.', 'Dreamyard Prepatory School is a community, with around 300 students everyone knows each other. My favorite experiences include opportunist to build my community and learn Fordom each other. If I could do it again, I would definitely pick Dreamyard.', ""The teachers at this school go above and beyond what is asked if them. I'm not saying they hold students hands but they guid them in a way that the students can start to learn for themselves.

Throughout my  entire high school year, I gained a lot of experience such as communications skills and the ability to be independent. One thing I admire about this school is that it really encourages individuals and students to be able to express their thoughts and be open minded as possible. I honestly think this school is a great fit for any individual who is trying to broaden their skills and be successful.', 'What i like the most about Dream yard, is the diversity and the different backgrounds that staff, teacher, faculties and students bring to the environment.', 'I believe that DreamYard is an amazing school for students who want to find themselves and explore more about their likes and dislikes. For instance, if you’re an artist or interested in art, whether it’s dance, theater, music or visual art, students would learn to excel in each category, due to the fun loving and extremely experienced teacher. However, if you’re interested in things non- art related, there are clubs that are student driven, such as Anime Club, Mouse Squad,  Bowling Club, Video Club, Cheerleading clubs and much more.  This school is mainly into arts, but many of the clubs mentioned are very inclusive. Although, when it comes to the academic side, there are many classes with supportive teachers who push you every day to do your best.  Also, we now have AP FOR ALL!!  Therefore, this would be the perfect school for anyone who wants to access their creativity side and take rigorous courses to be LIFE- READY!!', 'My Experience in Dreamyard wasn’t the best but they are very supportive. If your really into Art Dreamyard is the best choice.', 'I like how the community feels very close and how the teachers build a close relationship with students in order to know how to help them get better. There is also no separation between grades, so everyone socializes with everyone. One thing I would like to see change is a cleaner space, like the bathrooms.', 'Dreamyard Preparatory School is an amazing high school located in Bronx, NY. Dreamyard is a performing arts school that exposes theater, musical theater, dance, art and music to its students. They have annual plays that are exceptional, moving and wonderful. Last year was The Lion King and I heard that for the 2017 year it would be Rent. Overall it is a wonderful school that has a very supporitive environment and I would reccomend this school to anyone who wants to learn in a judge free zone.', ""Dreamyard at first was annoying I didn't like it but as time went on I met some amazing people and friends. Dreamyard is the school to go to."", ""Dreamyard Prep is a great school that has many opportunities.

My favorite experiences include opportunist to build my community and learn Fordom each other. If I could do it again, I would definitely pick Dreamyard.', ""The teachers at this school go above and beyond what is asked if them.

There are very few people you can be friends with bc of the small school there is. the school is okay and you can survive 4 years there if you keep to yourself."", ""I grew up in this school. Most of the teachers know what they're doing and because it's a small school, they have more of a connection with students who choose to allow one to be formed. They generally care about the students beyond the classroom which only pushes them to support them further in their studies and in life afterwards. Some of the teachers are matters at their craft and at teaching it due to their passion for the subject they teach. On the other hand, some don't really know how to teach what they know, so those are most likely the subjects you'll do worse in. You're going to hate math due to the fact that you'll be ahead of math yet may not understandans you'll be pushed to excel in math when you don't understand it because the math section of the curriculum is unorganized.

Ices are rare which is frustrating because we all like them very much.', ""If you (mostly along with the majority of the class) are late to your classes often, you will very likely have privileges taken away.\r Also, the cell phone policy is strict so you most likely want to keep your smartphone in your pocket.

Also, parents do get called often if a student is being disorderly."", 'Our school teams are called East New York Family Academy Eagles.

On the other hand, some don't really know how to teach what they know, so those are most likely the subjects you'll do worse in.

They really want you to succeed and ensure that you are aware of everything you need to know when it comes down to applying for colleges, scholarships, and they even set up field trip for college fairs.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,,,

Although her classmates since Pre-school went to the local High School, Ashley, through research and site visits choose to attend Bound Brook. The opportunities she has been offered in this new school have been endless, from the classes she has been able to take and the small class sizes to the extra curricular activities she has joined. Ashley was a student who disliked writing but because of her Freshman English teacher, she has found her passion and hidden talent. Now we can't stop her from writing. The administrative team is very approachable and visible. Now every school has the teacher that has his/her own agendas and Bound Brook is no different but we have been lucky enough to only have to deal with a few of them, so far. The High School Ashley was supposed to go to was larger in size and had many more clubs/activities, not to mention only being 5 minuted from home. Bur during her site visit and attending some sporting events, Ashley witnessed some disturbing events, such as open use and distribution of narcotics, which made her feel unsafe. We are blessed to have raised such an incredible young lady who can make wise decisions and not be drawn in by peer pressure. When she announced she was not going to the local HS with her classmates, many of her friends stopped talking to her, including her best friend since Kindergarten.  You can imagine the sorrow this cause her, it broke our heart. But after being in Bound Brook 3 years so far, she says it was by far the best decision she has made.  Bound Brook is a great High School with many great students, teachers and parents. Not many parents are active in the school because of the area demographics, many work two jobs to support their families and others do not speak English"", 'Not very informative that there are any', 'The parents of the students should be involved more', ""The teachers are good but don't seem to challenge"", ""I don't know too much about the safety in this school, but from my personal experiences, it is pretty average. There is really nothing more I can say about it."", ""Athletics are very popular and supported in this high school, but other clubs really don't get much support or promotion at all. The wrestling and football teams receive a lot of support from the school and receive money as well. However, as a member of the robotics team, we don't get any kind of support at all—not even moral support. Whenever robotics is mentioned around the athletic director or the assistant principal, they would laugh at our faces. The superintendent of the school district even laughed at a student's face when asked about varsity recognition. In short, I believe all the school really cares about is athletics and could care less about other activities such as robotics."", 'What I like most about this high school is the diversity in the students and the robotics team. Besides that, there is nothing really so special. Classes are limited and the staff treats students as if they are still in elementary school. The school really does not prepare the students to go to college because they treat us like kids.', ""There are many good teachers at this school, but there are also many bad ones as well. This high school has always had a weak spot for science teachers, and in my personal experience, they really can't teach at all. However, some math and English teachers go above and beyond and show the students that they care about them and their success in the future. Most of the other teachers are just average and don't stay after school to help out kids."", ""There aren't as many extracurricular activities in this school. That could be because we are such a small school that not many people have the time to do a lot of clubs or will join some of the clubs. For example, we have a debate club but there are only 5 students who are in it. If there were more kids who were interested in clubs then that would make extracurricular activities better."", 'My past four years in this school have been a roller coaster ride.

The opportunities she has been offered in this new school have been endless, from the classes she has been able to take and the small class sizes to the extra curricular activities she has joined. Ashley was a student who disliked writing but because of her Freshman English teacher, she has found her passion and hidden talent. Now we can't stop her from writing. The administrative team is very approachable and visible. Now every school has the teacher that has his/her own agendas and Bound Brook is no different but we have been lucky enough to only have to deal with a few of them, so far. The High School Ashley was supposed to go to was larger in size and had many more clubs/activities, not to mention only being 5 minuted from home. Bur during her site visit and attending some sporting events, Ashley witnessed some disturbing events, such as open use and distribution of narcotics, which made her feel unsafe. We are blessed to have raised such an incredible young lady who can make wise decisions and not be drawn in by peer pressure. When she announced she was not going to the local HS with her classmates, many of her friends stopped talking to her, including her best friend since Kindergarten.  You can imagine the sorrow this cause her, it broke our heart. But after being in Bound Brook 3 years so far, she says it was by far the best decision she has made.  Bound Brook is a great High School with many great students, teachers and parents. Not many parents are active in the school because of the area demographics, many work two jobs to support their families and others do not speak English"", 'Not very informative that there are any', 'The parents of the students should be involved more', ""The teachers are good but don't seem to challenge"", ""I don't know too much about the safety in this school, but from my personal experiences, it is pretty average. There is really nothing more I can say about it."", ""Athletics are very popular and supported in this high school, but other clubs really don't get much support or promotion at all. The wrestling and football teams receive a lot of support from the school and receive money as well. However, as a member of the robotics team, we don't get any kind of support at all—not even moral support. Whenever robotics is mentioned around the athletic director or the assistant principal, they would laugh at our faces. The superintendent of the school district even laughed at a student's face when asked about varsity recognition. In short, I believe all the school really cares about is athletics and could care less about other activities such as robotics."", 'What I like most about this high school is the diversity in the students and the robotics team. Besides that, there is nothing really so special. Classes are limited and the staff treats students as if they are still in elementary school. The school really does not prepare the students to go to college because they treat us like kids.', ""There are many good teachers at this school, but there are also many bad ones as well. This high school has always had a weak spot for science teachers, and in my personal experience, they really can't teach at all. However, some math and English teachers go above and beyond and show the students that they care about them and their success in the future. Most of the other teachers are just average and don't stay after school to help out kids."", ""There aren't as many extracurricular activities in this school. That could be because we are such a small school that not many people have the time to do a lot of clubs or will join some of the clubs. For example, we have a debate club but there are only 5 students who are in it. If there were more kids who were interested in clubs then that would make extracurricular activities better."", 'My past four years in this school have been a roller coaster ride. I came in as a freshman trying to explore all the opportunities bound Brook high school had to offer. Now that it is my senior year I found my self only liking a handful of clubs. Now, I am ready to move on from this school and move on to bigger and better things.', 'This school does try to be at an equal rate wi society but does struggle a bit. Some teachers will give you lessons that you are going to remember for a while, others you find yourself zoning out on them talking. There are only some clubs that I could count with two hands, and sports I could count with one. Overall, this school is tolerable, but needs to improve a bit.', 'very fun to be with at this school', 'This school is great for making you go forth', ""Every teacher at Bound Brook High School is very engaged with every student.

William L. Dickinson High School,"['My school is really good in academics It has really nice classes and great teachers but something I would like to change about my school is the how should students behave in school. Students should behave mannerly, politely, and respectfully to everyone.', 'Overall William L. Dickinson High School was a very diverse school but lacked college readiness in the English department which stunted my growth as a incoming college student. The social experience you gain from attending Dickinson is unique to the various cultures in within the school.', 'I loved the diversity of the school, I learned about so many cultures and different kinda of people. I also got views from people from wealthier backgrounds and less fortunate backgrounds. I did not like how loosely they teach, and how little they communicate, it could be much more efficient and there could be a greater focus on the school work.', 'I have learned a lot in Dickinson, not only toward academics but also towards life. Dickinson taught me how to deal with situations wisely and the smart actions to take. I learned a lot from my teachers and from the environment around me, I learned that you have to be focused because if you fall, you set yourself up for failure. This school made me who I am and I believe that If I would have went to any other High School I wouldn’t have learned half of what I know today.', 'William L. Dickinson is one of those few schools where I found academics went along with extra curricular activities. The staff are really helpful. Students get problems very often but the school manages it well. Diversity Honor Success fits the school well.I just hope more clubs are opened in the school so that students get opportunities to be engaged .I would recommend this school to new students who seek for better future.', 'I’ll begin by saying the things I don’t like about Dickinson. To begin with the late rooms are terrible because how you get detention from being 4 minutes late but not 20, they just take an absence which you can make up. Secondly, there are many motivating and education involved students which are a positive influence but, many others can be involved in school activities and sports and always try to involve you in drama and negativity. Lastly, it’s plain and simple, some teachers are just rude and the food is terrible. Overall, I try and focus on the positive the funny and motivational teachers that try and help us progress to college as well as the good friendship made with optimistic people.', 'My experience here was alright. I honestly thought it would absolutely be like the show Degrassi.  But, instead it is the opposite it can be like a bit of like the show an idea what high school can be like.  I had my ups and downs but it is part of life to deal with highschool and mature within overtime. Overall it is a safe school. I like how they had a CPR class which i am highly interested. I want to be expose in these type of environment and be able to prepare in life when necessary. I want to see less diversity. I just feel comfortable and how i like to try to be in a bit of a less diverse school.', 'Great school overall, just needs to work on its communication with parents. Wonderful faculty and staff, most teachers are extremely helpful and will stay after school in order to help students. Really diverse crowd; no student would ever feel like they are ""different"" or being left out.', ""William L. Dickinson high school is an amazingly diverse school. It exposes you to a variety of cultures and ideas. It's not a typical school where kids are mostly oriented by the similar goals. Here you come across very complex, unique, smart, not excluding, troublesome individuals. It's up to a student to make the rational decisions, hang out with the good crowd and work hard to pursue their dream or goal. Staff is encouraging and will assist you. All of the teachers that I encountered were amazing. However, the part of the school that I wish was different is the spirit. DHS doesn't have a strong school spirit which makes it somewhat boring for most kids here."", 'The teachers are really good and the overall education part is great. I would like to see some type of renovation to the entire school since the buildings are really old. It would be great if the school was modernized. The school itself is really good but being in Jersey City, some students were part of or joined gangs and got into fights and a lot of them didn’t really care about school and kind of ruined everything for the majority of the student body who actually did care. The uniforms were also a pain.', ""My experience was awesome. I learned a lot of things which got me ready for my future.Some teachers were awesome and very helpful. The only thing i didn't like about this school is that the students fighting caused so much distraction to the studies."", 'Mostly everyone knew each other. Enjoyed going to school because of the teachers and students. Even with bad reputation that is given for he school i can say It’s the best high school in the district. You get to experience different cultures since It is the moat diverse school in the district. I have no regrets spending my four years in high school there i couldn’t ask for more then what i received.', 'I have heard many negative responses about Dickinson before I became a former student, which is all very very unstable and judge mental, for in Dickinson I have learned to carry the responsibility on my own, learning to find the right career for myself, respect diversity and honor, yes it isn’t true in Dickinson we have some trouble makers but that doesn’t ruin the school because some silly ones that don’t know how to act are messing everything up for the rest. I love Dickinson don’t regret a day being there, thank you to all the teachers who put effort and making us the mature ones we are now', 'This school is amazing. Teachers there are always willing to help you. There is a lot of AP courses available to those who like to challenge themselves through their course of their High School career.', 'This is my senior year at Dickinson and has been a treacherous journey. There were good moments and bad moments but overall i think My time at Dickinson has been a wonderful experience.', ""Dickinson High School is a good school for the students who want to learn. The school is very big so it's really hard to be able to get one on one time with teachers if you need help. The biggest issue is the administration, sadly they only do the bare minimum and it doesn't seem as though they care about the students, they mostly care about what the school looks like to other people like their bosses. The teachers get treated unfairly, and a lot of school events or even basic information are just unorganized."", 'I have attended Dickinson High for about 4 years. I have participated in many sports and clubs provided by the school. Everyone gets along and teachers help the students when they need it the most. The school is very diversified. There are many cultures that come together under one building and see that is extraordinary.', 'What I loved about William L. Dickinson was the huge diversity within the students and staff. It truly is such a special and different experience to attend a school where you can learn about so many different cultures and traditions.', 'I’ve only  joined this year so far, however the experience has been mostly amazing. The students  are nice and most of the teachers actually do what they’re supposed to do, teach.

Students should behave mannerly, politely, and respectfully to everyone.', 'Overall William L. Dickinson High School was a very diverse school but lacked college readiness in the English department which stunted my growth as a incoming college student. The social experience you gain from attending Dickinson is unique to the various cultures in within the school.', 'I loved the diversity of the school, I learned about so many cultures and different kinda of people. I also got views from people from wealthier backgrounds and less fortunate backgrounds. I did not like how loosely they teach, and how little they communicate, it could be much more efficient and there could be a greater focus on the school work.', 'I have learned a lot in Dickinson, not only toward academics but also towards life. Dickinson taught me how to deal with situations wisely and the smart actions to take. I learned a lot from my teachers and from the environment around me, I learned that you have to be focused because if you fall, you set yourself up for failure. This school made me who I am and I believe that If I would have went to any other High School I wouldn’t have learned half of what I know today.', 'William L. Dickinson is one of those few schools where I found academics went along with extra curricular activities. The staff are really helpful.

To begin with the late rooms are terrible because how you get detention from being 4 minutes late but not 20, they just take an absence which you can make up. Secondly, there are many motivating and education involved students which are a positive influence but, many others can be involved in school activities and sports and always try to involve you in drama and negativity. Lastly, it’s plain and simple, some teachers are just rude and the food is terrible. Overall, I try and focus on the positive the funny and motivational teachers that try and help us progress to college as well as the good friendship made with optimistic people.', 'My experience here was alright. I honestly thought it would absolutely be like the show Degrassi.  But, instead it is the opposite it can be like a bit of like the show an idea what high school can be like.

Mather Building Arts & Craftsmanship High School,"['i like how can work with my hands a lot it is a small school so the students get lots of attention and if a student needs help with something, they can go to the teacher after school or lunch to get the help', ""The staff at Mather are very friendly and helpful. Many of the teachers had open tutoring time when different students, no matter what grade, could come in for help. All you had to do was build a relationship and show up. While the focus was on craftsmanship, it was more of another field to explore. They encouraged us to look at our options and helped us investigate our interests. The only thing I wish was different is how communication works. Although the students are allowed to talk about how they feel at town hall or off-line, sometimes it feels like certain matters aren't open for discussion. At times it felt like answers weren't being properly given. Don't get me wrong, they try and do a good job, but there's always room for improvement. They're a new school and they are open to change, with a calm, proper argument."", ""Mather highschool was an experience. They are a CTE based school so each year you're taught something different in the trades. Starting with historic preservation, then landscape and decorative finishing, then carpentry and masonry. You get a taste of all the different trades and branches you can go into. Ending senior year, everyone takes a NOCTI exam, if you pass you get a CTE endorsement. The school has amazing connections with some colleges, and National parks. The students may not be amazing and there are a few questionable teachers but the school overall is pretty average in general. I just hope that the school gets more students willing to do good in school, succeed and respect others along with staff members, also administration should allow themselves to take criticism even if it's from one student. It may seem like only one student has a problem with how something is being done, but in reality there's plenty of others who just won't say it."", 'Honestly this is School is a great school, the teachers there truly enjoys their job and wish for the best for their students. They work together with each other, the students and their parents to consistently find ways to improve the way their teaching and or to figure out what methods need to be implemented to improve the students performance either it be peer/adult tutoring, one on one sit down with the teachers themselves,  or practice online with khan academy etc. not only that but this school also highly prepares there students for the outside world when their ready to pursue their careers, with internships either provide by at the school or outside of it.       Not only that but they also provide college and AP courses  through their connections, for their students, to get them at least one step ahead in college. They also plan out creative events and trips to reward the students on their hard work and to encourage them to maintain their steady progress to success.', 'This school is focused on the trades, which are important for those that are looking for hands-on activities involving lumber, electric and manual tools, and paint. This school has several partnerships such as with the National Parks. Nonetheless, this school is not the one for those that are intrigued in STEM-related career. You will still need to do extra work outside of classroom to be a level with other students in the city. This is school has limited amount of AP or high-level classes, which are a disadvantage to those that aspire to go to college. In short, this school will fit better to those that have an aspiration to work in agriculture, landscape, preservation, and/or architecture.', 'The overall atmosphere In the school is really inviting. the teachers really care for the students as if they were a second pair of parents away from home. And while the school lunch is or can be unpleasing to the eye the school makes up for by having parties, about a party every month with food and chips etc. the campus combine all of the sports so instead of the teams being individual from each school in the building there all just one big team instead. That being said the building contains about five different school amongst its seven floors. with a school for elementary students comprising the second and third floor and a Mather being manning on the fourth floor but having about 4 classes on the sixth floor. the teachers can be really annoying but they all have you best interest at heart, and can sometimes drive you crazy with deadlines.', ""Stephen t mather is an excellent highschool, they're coporated with the national parks.

Responsibility, action-oriented, collaboration, consciousness, and aware."", 'Mather Building Arts & Craftsmanship High School is an excellent school. Its full of rich school culture, caring teachers, and relatable/challenging curriculum.

Only thing id change about this school is the clubs and activities it offers, which is little to none.', 'I was a freshmen. I wasn’t there since the school first started no complaints.

There's diversity in the staff so everyone feels welcome and can relate to the students."", ""Going to any Manhattan public school is excellent and has great education. Having gone to Mather High School the academic is average I must say, since we mainly follow the common core curriculum at this school  I feel as if it's making the learning much more complicated than what it needs to be. Although the teachers of this school is its best highlight. All teachers and the  school overall have such a passionate way of teaching something new every day and giving the help students need.

Unity is necessary to succeed against odds and it is vital to my community's infallible withstanding."", 'Even though I am still in school as a Senior, it was a very great experience for me having ups and downs but always kept pushing to my limits.

You do however, have your few that are very by the book and make you feel as if they are just there for a job. Almost every teacher has their own way about doing certain things so there are a variety of different teaching styles and most will try to teach in a manner you learn best. The main problem kids have with most teachers is their grading policies, most teachers use these online grade calculators that do not account for the student as a person or for their participation in class making many feel as if these robotic grades aren't a true reflection of them in the classroom."", 'The school building is up to date for the most part. They recently painted the hallways orange which many people have been complaining about, but I am a fan of it. There are many resources available whether it is for tutoring for a certain class or college prep.

The school has not always had a wide variety of electives but have been creating more and more in the recent years. Some teachers really do not care about the class they teach, so in return makes the students not care much about that class neither. For the required classes to graduate you learn the material needed to know and minimum homework is given out. Trying to fox an error on your program/schedule is almost impossible considering there is only to guidance counselors for the whole school and they are always busy.

Being here since freshman year has taught me a lot, and although I may have had better education elsewhere,  I wouldn\'t say that I entirely regret coming here. During freshman year we had a different principal, who honestly made the entire year not as productive or organized as it should have been, but I was able to acknowledge the diverse friends that I still remain close with. I have learned that it is really up to yourself to get things done. If you don\'t find out on your own, you wont be told about what you need to do to have a good profile for college. Participate in activities when you can, stay focused and don\'t be a fool of yourself just for ""cool"" factors. Good grades are simple to achieve, try to find summer opportunities in the city, and definitely look into colleges early. quest is pretty alright if you choose the right crowd and just do what will benefit yourself', 'Going to Questo To Learn was an interesting experience. The students weren\'t involved in the school so it was not a fun environment to be around since everyone was in their own world. Overall the teachers were great and I made close relationships with the majority of them. I give Quest To Learn three out of five stars because in my personal experience in my 9th-10th year we didn\'t have a real principle, and we had a ""fill in"" and the school was a mess.

Went it comes to the school's facility and available resources, Vanguard High School lacks cleanliness and a lot of resources such as simple things like colored paper or colored ink.
