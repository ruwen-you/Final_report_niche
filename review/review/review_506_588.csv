The students can build a friendship inside the classroom with the teachers without being disruptive on the learning and professional environment.', 'The school policies change every year, but the big ones like: suspensions, lunch restriction, bullying, cellphone policy, and locker search, are consistent. The small ones which include: reasons to get detention, school uniform, bathroom policy, and class times change often. The school needs to work on bettering the handbook; making it more specific instead of letting it be open to interpretation by the deans.', 'Like any other schools NHACS wants their students to succeed. Keeping in mind that all students learn differently and at different speeds, each student is assigned classes to challenge them but not over work their brains to the point where coming to school become the bane of their day. There are also ""intervention"" classes assigned to the students where they focus on working on the subject of skill they struggle with. These ""intervention"" classes do a great job at providing extra help when after school help conflicts with students responsibilities at home.', ""The students are allowed to create any after school programs they are interested in and get the program approved. There is a variety of extracurricular activities for both high school and middle school. Some of these include: boxing, cooking, running club, mural project, tutoring the middle school, yearbook, prom committee, senior trip committee, bake sales. The middle school is more involved in after school actives, but the high school does a good job at getting students involved im fun raisers for their grades and planning of school wide events. The 16 house captains of the high school take care of organizing every detail of school dances. The yearbook committee works extremely hard to include memories from 5-12th grade into an amazing book. Although the high school is not as involved as the middle school I'm after school activities they do work extremely hard to make their last 4 years memorable."", ""The school building is an old factory which was turned into a church, and later on into New Heights Academy Charter School. Due to the fact that the building is pretty old moving the desks can be a hassle if the floor below is testing. The  building  has narrow hallways which always causes traffic jams. Students hate used to the  traffic jams because  they occur on a daily basis. This year the school has done a good job at preventing traffic jams by creating different schedules for the middle school and the high school so there won't be as many kids in the hallway at once. The school also does not have a gym or field for the students. However, the public park a block away from the school  serves as a field for gym class in the spring. Although  the students do not have an inside field the  public park allows students to get some fresh air during gym. The school bathroom are maintained every cleaned."", 'The teachers spend more time in school then they do at home.

Harvest Collegiate High School,"[""My experience at Harvest wasn't the best or worst. Socially, Harvest is toxic. Students there have drug issues & pressure other students to do drugs for social status. Academically, Harvest does an amazing job in the English department & since Harvest opts out of regents, gateways & capstones are done instead. I'm college ready when it comes to writing 8-12 page papers, seminars, & daily readings because that's what Harvest's focus. Harvest doesn't focus on Math, Science, and Language. I have gone a year without a math or science class. Harvest only offers French or Spanish in Junior year & is taken for one semester, but counts as a full year course. The AP classes are well taught, but the students must be mentally prepared. The Music classes are amazing. You will learn how to play an instrument at Harvest. I have seen surprising growth of students musical abilities throughout my 4 years. Harvest is an unusual school. Take advantage of everything it offers for the best experience."", 'When I went to Harvest, I was in a very hard transition in my life. Growing older and connecting with others was difficult for me. I had a severe lack of independence and and self confidence. However, Harvest was a community filled with people like myself, who were going through issues and becoming more of who they saw themselves as. I was the fourth graduating class ever so the school is very young, which can help explain their own issues while growing and trying to find their identity outside the norm of most high schools. There is a disparity in the relatively small departments. The science and math department is lacking despite a few great instructors and the literature department has a track record of major success with students. Considering the schools size, students can always find a friend, support structure or outlet for expression that is important when growing which is something Harvest Collegiate High School excels at.', 'I graduated from this school in January of 2019, I had to graduate early because the school environment was horrible, there were very depressive vibes from students and teachers both and thats not okay.

Socially, Harvest is toxic. Students there have drug issues & pressure other students to do drugs for social status. Academically, Harvest does an amazing job in the English department & since Harvest opts out of regents, gateways & capstones are done instead. I'm college ready when it comes to writing 8-12 page papers, seminars, & daily readings because that's what Harvest's focus. Harvest doesn't focus on Math, Science, and Language. I have gone a year without a math or science class. Harvest only offers French or Spanish in Junior year & is taken for one semester, but counts as a full year course. The AP classes are well taught, but the students must be mentally prepared. The Music classes are amazing. You will learn how to play an instrument at Harvest.

I was the fourth graduating class ever so the school is very young, which can help explain their own issues while growing and trying to find their identity outside the norm of most high schools. There is a disparity in the relatively small departments.

In contrast, I was disappointed by the limited range of sports to join, specifically only having a men's basketball and women's volleyball team when I was a student and I believe the school must gain more funding for their music program.

The new administration has really made an effort to add more AP classes and dual credit courses. Though it may all sound nice, it isn\'t really all that great.

The school has about 90 stairs and every day I have to go up from the fifth to the first just to go the fifth for l.e then go back down for gym then go to the second just to go back again to the fifth (if you like stairs and want to work out your calves perfect school for you). The teachers and student complain about not having a.c during the spring but it is on during the winter. The kids get in a fight about once or twice every month. They keep trying to add more students to get more funding(at least that what the teachers say) and the student don't appreciate the teachers well enough.

Most of them also follow the normal high school style teaching, standing next to a board and talking before handing out worksheets and having the students take notes or finish."", ""The school is unique in its very own way. The community there is very diverse and friendly based on my experience. For instance, during last years' talent show people messed up, but no one laughed or ridiculed the performers, the crowd cheered them on. Additionally, the staff are very kind and understanding, they actually care about their students well-being and success.

I feel they're very resourceful, and as long as you're willing, you'll have plenty of chances to expand your knowledge and learning opportunities beyond the classroom.

A calmer environment would ease more people into the flow of High School."", 'They let me fix my schedule how I wanted it multiple times to suit what I wanted.

The security is also kind as well.', 'hillcrest high school is a large school with great diversity and a lot of valuable courses that can guide you to be on track for college. the school overall is okay, however the students leave a bad mark on the schools reputation and trademark.

For example, you get the opportunity to take the leadership class where you get to learn how to improve on yourself and most importantly you get to help other people out by doing fundraising, raising awareness about the problems that most people are facing and by donating blood.  Also, there are some really nice teachers that you could trust and if you have any problems they could help you out.

If there is not a club that suits you, you can always create a club. Some things that I would like to change is the food quality, which many have complained about. Also there is not much parent involvement in students lives, which causes students to not try hard enough.

The teachers and faculty are there for you to listen and talk even if they don't look like it. The main issue is the under payment. The faculty and staff encourages the students to use what they've learned and add it into their lives and change the world. The connections made at this school may never fade and I dread the time it comes for me to leave the friends and family I've created.

Throughout my 6 years in the school, I’ve felt stuck. Everything is the exact same each year and we get no support system', ""I am a senior now at RKA and I actually love the school. People are always trying to say that our school is bad but that isn't true at all. We are one of the best public schools in the Bronx."", 'Riverdale kingsbridge Academy is a middle and high school. It holds around 1,300 students. Many of these students are from very diverse areas and have very loud personalities. You learn something new everyday. The area is also very safe and likable. There are many things that can be to your convenience.', ""Riverdale Kingsbridge Academy is a diverse school in a safe neighborhood. Here, I've been exposed to a variety of people and cultures. I wish that they offered a more rigorous curriculum to prepare me for life after high school. Overall, I've had a great experience. I've learned a lot about myself and how to work collaboratively with others."", ""I was exposed to many different kinds of people and experiences, but I wasn't prepared well for the college process"", 'this school is filled with bullies teacher are getting disrespected  all the time food is terrible teachers are unprofessional deans are very disrespectful  kids are always distracting others fights almost every day', 'My school experience was very mediocre in this institution. Classes were of mediocre level, and there were not enough activities that urged students to become more involved and active in school. High school seniors were also not readily prepared for college, which made the transition very hard considering the mounts of workload we receive versus the high school workload we were used to.Teachers, for the most part, were kind and hard working but there were others who seemed not fit for the teaching field.Students were mostly kind to each other and bullying was not a usual occurence within the building. Because classes were not so rigorous, students were able to relax a bit more and had enought time to build relationships with fellow classmates and faculty. Overall, my experience at RKA was not a 5-star rating, but the good memories from my time in the institution earned it 3 stars.', 'My experience at the school is mostly high. Most teachers genuinely love what they do however some teachers and administrators make being in school unbearable. Students are not allowed to sit quietly in the halls during free periods and lunch along with countless other pointless rules that make leaving at the end of the day pure bliss. Sports at this school are great, with teams going to cities, states, and even nationals. Being a part of these teams definitely betters your school experience.', 'RKA is an excellent school. They have good math, science and history teachers however their ELA program needs development. RKA has a fair ethnic diversity student and faculty wise. They have many sports times that are at the top of their divisions and a wide range of clubs. RKA has a lot of opportunities for students to get involved in school through the theatre, arts, clubs, and sports. RKA could also improve on preparing students for college.', 'RKA is a really great school that gives each student the opportunity to become more involved and enhance who they are and who they can be. Rka is very involved with sports but they don’t always take part in the student’s lives.', ""I went to RKA from 6th grade to 9th. The classes are good, but really only if you're in honors. From what I have heard from many former classmates, the non-honors classes consist mostly of students messing around and making lots of noise, with only a few students actually trying to learn.Because of the small size of the school, there aren't that many clubs, but the variety is still decent. A majority of the students are nice and willing to help you. A big downside to the school was the lack of APs and other special classes."", ""RKA is an average high school. There isn't a very large course selection, the food is as bad as public food gets, there are a decent amount of sports teams, and there aren't a lot of facilities. The teachers are the best part of the school."", 'If you are willing to put the effort and have a goal to put education as your number one priority, then RKA is a place for you. Keep in mind this is not a high school with enough spirit.', 'What I liked the most about MS/HS 141 is the environment in the school. The diversity of the students, staff, and especially teachers is amazing to be apart of. All staff members are here to help and will always push you to do the best you can! Teachers, Deans and Principles are constantly telling you to apply for colleges, scholarships, and give the best advice on moving on from highschool to be an adult..', ""Overall, attending RKA has been amazing. While others might focus of the few negatives of a public school education, I will discuss the many benefits. RKA has some of the most dedicated teachers around, many teachers stay way past the end of the school day to ensure their students' success. RKA is the top non-specialized school in The Bronx, and is known for its fabulous sports programs."", ""Honestly, RKA is all about what you make of it. Sure, it's very easy to complain about the level of work, or the students, or the setup and the work. But what does that get done, really? RKA has done so much for me. I have had achievements in all platforms at this school- recognition for my academic endeavors, sports accomplishment, praise of my peers and teachers, the list goes on and go. RKA offers a variety of classes at various skill levels, but most of all, is fair in its academics. It can be some of the simplest, learning experiences, or, a long, grueling journey to pass. It's all up to you and how you make it!"", 'What I liked about 141 was the faculty and staff, the students on the other hand were my least favorite part. this school was filled with bullies from 6th grade all the way to 12th. You cant change all the students but other than that it was a pretty solid experience. Oh wait! then I forget they cut dance out of the curriculum and for some reason seem to think they cant provide any arts at this school. It was such a pity for kids that wanted to sing, dance or, play an instrument(talented kids by the way). arts are just as important as sports!!!!', ""RKA is 50/50. The middle school section, I don't care for much. But I want to focus on the high school, which is in my opinion is great. There are tons of extra curricular activities and clubs, lots of great sports teams, and great teachers. People usually say the teachers are hard to deal with, but that's because the students themselves are giving them a hard time.

Classes were of mediocre level, and there were not enough activities that urged students to become more involved and active in school. High school seniors were also not readily prepared for college, which made the transition very hard considering the mounts of workload we receive versus the high school workload we were used to.Teachers, for the most part, were kind and hard working but there were others who seemed not fit for the teaching field.Students were mostly kind to each other and bullying was not a usual occurence within the building. Because classes were not so rigorous, students were able to relax a bit more and had enought time to build relationships with fellow classmates and faculty. Overall, my experience at RKA was not a 5-star rating, but the good memories from my time in the institution earned it 3 stars.', 'My experience at the school is mostly high. Most teachers genuinely love what they do however some teachers and administrators make being in school unbearable. Students are not allowed to sit quietly in the halls during free periods and lunch along with countless other pointless rules that make leaving at the end of the day pure bliss. Sports at this school are great, with teams going to cities, states, and even nationals. Being a part of these teams definitely betters your school experience.', 'RKA is an excellent school. They have good math, science and history teachers however their ELA program needs development. RKA has a fair ethnic diversity student and faculty wise. They have many sports times that are at the top of their divisions and a wide range of clubs. RKA has a lot of opportunities for students to get involved in school through the theatre, arts, clubs, and sports. RKA could also improve on preparing students for college.', 'RKA is a really great school that gives each student the opportunity to become more involved and enhance who they are and who they can be. Rka is very involved with sports but they don’t always take part in the student’s lives.', ""I went to RKA from 6th grade to 9th. The classes are good, but really only if you're in honors. From what I have heard from many former classmates, the non-honors classes consist mostly of students messing around and making lots of noise, with only a few students actually trying to learn.Because of the small size of the school, there aren't that many clubs, but the variety is still decent. A majority of the students are nice and willing to help you. A big downside to the school was the lack of APs and other special classes."", ""RKA is an average high school. There isn't a very large course selection, the food is as bad as public food gets, there are a decent amount of sports teams, and there aren't a lot of facilities.

The diversity of the students, staff, and especially teachers is amazing to be apart of. All staff members are here to help and will always push you to do the best you can! Teachers, Deans and Principles are constantly telling you to apply for colleges, scholarships, and give the best advice on moving on from highschool to be an adult..', ""Overall, attending RKA has been amazing. While others might focus of the few negatives of a public school education, I will discuss the many benefits. RKA has some of the most dedicated teachers around, many teachers stay way past the end of the school day to ensure their students' success. RKA is the top non-specialized school in The Bronx, and is known for its fabulous sports programs."", ""Honestly, RKA is all about what you make of it. Sure, it's very easy to complain about the level of work, or the students, or the setup and the work. But what does that get done, really? RKA has done so much for me. I have had achievements in all platforms at this school- recognition for my academic endeavors, sports accomplishment, praise of my peers and teachers, the list goes on and go. RKA offers a variety of classes at various skill levels, but most of all, is fair in its academics. It can be some of the simplest, learning experiences, or, a long, grueling journey to pass. It's all up to you and how you make it!"", 'What I liked about 141 was the faculty and staff, the students on the other hand were my least favorite part. this school was filled with bullies from 6th grade all the way to 12th. You cant change all the students but other than that it was a pretty solid experience. Oh wait! then I forget they cut dance out of the curriculum and for some reason seem to think they cant provide any arts at this school. It was such a pity for kids that wanted to sing, dance or, play an instrument(talented kids by the way). arts are just as important as sports!!!!', ""RKA is 50/50. The middle school section, I don't care for much. But I want to focus on the high school, which is in my opinion is great. There are tons of extra curricular activities and clubs, lots of great sports teams, and great teachers. People usually say the teachers are hard to deal with, but that's because the students themselves are giving them a hard time.

Manville HS has never failed to teach me that we must respect each other despite our differences - and that is a life lesson that can\'t be taken away.', 'I like how small Manville High School is. I graduated with about 100 people in my class and knew all of my classmates pretty well. The school lunch was not that great.', ""Great small school where one knows you.  Great one on one with all teachers but I feel that students could be pushed for much more. If a student comes in high honors it's very easy to loose all that was accomplished."", 'I very much enjoyed the small town feel of Manville High School. It allowed you to be able to get one on one experience with the teachers and form bonds with both staff and students.', ""Overall, throughout my years at Manville High School and in the Manville school system, I can say that even with the stress of honors classes, clubs and everything in my student life, I enjoyed every bit of it. The volunteering to help tutor at the elementary school, working for the school's musical productions, and being a part of the sports team is what Manville is all about. Helping out your community and being a part of the change. Manville is such a small town, but what most people don't understand is that we are such a close town. Every grade is small so we all know one another and have grown up together. We help each other out, and we always come out to support our town in sports events and such. The teachers are great and students are very friendly. You can always make a friend. Even when I graduate, I'll come back to visit. This town is my home and if you're from Manville, you're a mustang and always will be."", 'The school provides you with basic, traditional learning classes. Nothing special about waking up and going to a high school where everyone knows each other and all the teachers know everything about you. Where teachers are more involved with the students personal rather than academic life. Where teachers will tell you upfront that school is only important for those who care about it. Sit down in a desk all period long listen to music and ask you what kind of grade you want. nothing special about graduating from a school where one of your youngest, ""coolest"" teacher got arrested for being involved with a minor.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['The staff has great training on all of these matters and stays updated on newer techniques to cope with todays issues.', 'OffersWrestling, Football,Baseball,Basketball,Track,Softball,Soccer, and many clubs for students that choose not to be involved in team sports.', ""They're almost never available.

I have learned more about reality there rather than anything useful in the academics. I have learned a lot from all the different personalities i have met from teachers and other fellow students from all grades above or below me. A change that could be made that would have an impact on the school would be having better counseling services and/or student involvement, having students voices and opinions heard instead of oppressing issues that take place within the school and having more interaction with them through better activities to offer such as more sports, clubs, etc.', 'My experience at the Celia Cruz high school has been great.

If you are considering taking music seriously, this school will prepare you for the steps and challenges it gets in order for you to really understand music. You will definitely be cared for in this school by the staff since they're constantly guiding the students. This school is also very diverse, inclusive towards anyone. My only wish for this school is to work towards making more rooms for the music classes, along with a suitable auditorium for performances.

Academics are average, sports are okay, and teachers are good and they seem to care a lot about their students. In terms of their specialty which is music, the school does a great job and has passionate music teachers who are always there to help their students.  The music program in this school is one of the best in the city and can really open doors for students throughout high school as well as afterwards. Academic wise, I think the school should be more challenging, though the AP classes are good in terms of that, regular classes are fairly simple and require for students to  stay on top of their work as well as having a fair understanding of the work.

We take both beginner and seasoned musicians, teaching them what they need according to their musical level.

My favorite moments come from my band class with my music teacher Ms. Jacono she has taught me some many things about music's connection to life and the environment around us as people and the many wonders of music."", 'Celia Cruz high school is a really diverse school. Academics are average, sports are okay, and teachers are good and they seem to care a lot about their students. In terms of their specialty which is music, the school does a great job and has passionate music teachers who are always there to help their students.  The music program in this school is one of the best in the city and can really open doors for students throughout high school as well as afterwards. Academic wise, I think the school should be more challenging, though the AP classes are good in terms of that, regular classes are fairly simple and require for students to  stay on top of their work as well as having a fair understanding of the work. I would recommend this school for any student who is passionate about music as well as someone who is looking for a good school in the Bronx.', ""I will always cherish the memories I've made at the Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music, everything about it is phenomenal. The things I learned the things I have been able to do because of this school will influence me for a long time to come. The friends I have made here are the kind that lasts lifetimes and are some of the people I hold dearest to my heart. This school is amazing! We take both beginner and seasoned musicians, teaching them what they need according to their musical level. Along with performances in NYC, the school's students travel around the world frequently, going to places like Ireland, Spain, Canada, and touring in Europe. The school offers this and more along with all of the academic courses and AP classes you need to be extra prepared for college, regardless of what career you pursue. This school offers so much to their students, and I am forever in their debt for all they have done for me. Celia Cruz is not only a school but a community of music and family."", 'I loved my experience at Celia Cruz however I would like to see the food get better, as well as college readiness, and it have its own building.', 'A great school with lots of resources and opportunities to help students develop the musical and academic skills to follow their dreams both in and outside the classroom.', 'I love the opportunities and recognition that we receive from other schools and people by being in the choir, orchestra and/or band.

We have awesome teachers and guaidence counselors to help out with everything you need. They always keep you posted with events and things you need to know. It is a huge diversity of people and activities/ clubs to attend. The cleanness and the timed school day is just perfect. Most of all they make sure every student is good where they need to be.', 'Definitely not the best school environment. There are teachers that are just there and get their pay when they do not even teach. There are teachers that give life lessons though and those teachers tend to get hated by the students because after experiencing no work from other teachers, they are not used to so much work. Fights happen often and to lessen the fights the school shorten lunch periods to only 25 minutes thinking that it will help, when in reality the lunch ladies do not even serve quick enough leaving students to not have enough time to eat.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['My Nephew studies here.

My only request would be to work towards showcasing open-mindedness.', 'This a small school where everyone knows each other.

I learned enough to get into college and understand what I am learning in college.', 'It is a very small school and I understand why the resources are limited, but the school board should try a little harder to get programs for the kids like boys volleyball or lacrosse to accommodate to every students needs and not rob them of 4 years of a sport they would possible like very much and potentially play professionally.', 'I have 4 kids in the school and the love the school I tell then that we are going to buy another house, and the first question they ask was, have to be in Wallington they love the school.', ""I would like to see the teachers be more involved in their job and getting the students ready for college instead of focusing on making jokes and not paying attention to the students' behavior. I would like to see smartboards in every room and more resources."", 'The school is literally falling apart from lead in its water to missing bathroom door stalls, roof always needing work, the weight room being the size of a bathroom, etc....    School pride has been declining with the lack of pride days, uniforms, ect.. Apparently  we get funding but it gets used on new windows instead of fixing up the classrooms with no heat/ac or replacing materials. Sports are poorly funded; especially girl sports. We literally fail the health inspection every year. I have been going to this school for the past 5 yrs and nothing good comes from it. However I do have to say that the teachers care about their students.', 'It was good until they implemented school uniforms for all the schools. Then the school spirit died and everyone was miserable.', 'As an athlete who also joined as many clubs as possible, it really made school better. You had something to look forward to after school, and it helped you make friends. Sports were a huge part of this school and when the team did good and the games became more important, the student started a ""fanation"" and were able to get everyone out to support.', 'The school was small and close. The students in your class have been with you since kindergarten so friendships stay the same. We stick together and know each other even in other grades. I would go to this school again because I was able to form bonds and stay close to everyone in my town.', 'Since the school is so small, most teachers form bonds with the students, especially if the students are their athletes in a sport.', ""The workload is manageable, teachers will not over load you with work most of it is done in class as class work, teachers are good students just don't want to pay attention"", 'Being a small town in general, Wallington has little to no major crime, which is mainly why the school does not have a large amount of security. They have the standard equipment like security cameras, visitor sign-ins, and locked entrances, but other than that the school does not have much else. If a major incident was to occur, the students would basically be sitting ducks, as there are no other defenses besides the locked doors. Once someone gets inside they can really do what they please. One ""safety measure"" that the administration has put in place is he dress codes which ""will distinguish anyone who is not a student from the general populace"". Not a very encouraging safety measure. Last gouge I will say this town would most likely never need high security, it would be nice to have a little something extra than just the standard security used at my local convenience store.', ""When it comes to extracurriculars, Wallington is kind of a mixed bag.

Certain clubs at the school should be promoted more. Usually all you hear about is debate club or sports teams they barely mention anything else. There could also be lessons in class about different hertaiges instead of just putting posters up. College readiness could also be taught more. Overall the school isn't too bad.

There’s not that much of a population here, however the building was still way too small, I felt trapped. The worst thing about this school is it’s culture and the students there.

It helped us to better know and communicate with each other, and have someone to rely on. The college advisor keeps in touch and follows us throughout our four years. The teachers not only teach about the curriculum in order to pass exams, but also teach us about life lessons to better mature us for the future. There are so many activities that the school offers to get involved in our community, and help develop skills needed for college and beyond.

A lot is expected of students whether they want to pursue a career in technology or not, but the end is worth all the 4 years at the school. Everyone has their own opinions, but the teachers and faculty always try to ensure that when you leave the school, you leave with the knowledge of technology and a step in the right direction! My only concern is that the school didn’t offer a wide variety of AP classes which Would be a plus for students.', ""A great experience. Coming here means dealing with typical school food, and the somewhat meager resources you'd expect from a public high school. However, the school culture and teachers are astounding. Little to no instances of bullying in sight, and many students get along and talk in the classroom...a little too much ;). Teachers are usually phenomenal and care for their students not just on an academic level, but on a personal growth level as well. Shout out to our guidance counselor for putting our future's first, always :D. If school budget and resources were better, it would reach its full potential."", ""Being a student there was not so bad. During my freshman year, I felt the need to transfer because I thought that a career in computers wasn't for me. However, after sticking around for a few months, I learned that you can't judge a book by its cover. I honestly had a good time in my studies and the overall inclusiveness of the school. The one issue that I had was that it didn't offer a wide spectrum of classes to choose from, especially AP classes."", 'Attending the High School of Computers and Technology was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. Being a part of this school family has changed and shaped me into the young lady I am now becoming. I absolutely like everything about my school; it is a very disciplined and orderly behaved school. Attending the school I have gained amazing friendships and relationships with my classmates and also the staff in the school, also you learn a lot in the classroom not just work but life lessons. Everyone at HSCT is there to help and guide you along the way. However one thing that I would like to see change is the attendance of trips that I have attended when I just came to the school for the new students. When I came to the school we would go on overnight trips to Club Getaway which I think connected and built great bonds and friendships between the student body and staff. That would be something that will be nice to bring back.', 'As an incoming freshmen in September of 2013, my first impression was ""Wow, there\'s a lot of boys in this school! I think I might transfer."" Eventually, I became more comfortable because the adults were so friendly and open. A program called Peer Group Connect helped my class of 2017 as freshmen in many ways. It helped us to better know and communicate with each other, and have someone to rely on. The college advisor keeps in touch and follows us throughout our four years. The teachers not only teach about the curriculum in order to pass exams, but also teach us about life lessons to better mature us for the future. There are so many activities that the school offers to get involved in our community, and help develop skills needed for college and beyond. However, the principal needs to be more interactive with the students, Now, as a senior when I look back to the day I was a freshmen thinking about transferring, I don\'t regret it at all and I am happy with the choice I made.', 'After you get past the fact that this school is not what you think it is, it is an alright school. I have not had any issues thus far, the teachers treat you like family and look after you.', 'I love the fact that my high school ( High School Of Computers And Technology) is respectful and hardworking. The teachers and staff are dedicated to help prepare us for our nation ( The United States Of America), and as global citizens. Also, H.S.C.T has a wonderful principal ( Bruce Abramowitz). He is an excellent role model, and inspirer.  He loves everyone at H.S.C.T and treats us like his own flesh and blood, even if we are frustrating or disrespectful or angry at times. He understands us, and shared his experiences about his life growing up. He tries his very best to steer us on the right path everyday.  Mr.Abramowitz is a wonderful Principal and Second- Father. I am always: trustworthy, loyal, honest, respectful, and hardworking in his eyes. He is all the motivation that I need to say; "" Yes! I am a intelligent and decent young lady, and I know I can do anything I put my mind to especially, with his help and Jesus\'s help.', 'Teachers, and also staff, are really friendly and caring. They students to be serious about their work and attend college.', 'There are many extracurricular activities there is Skills USA which lets students attend in competitions, PGC which lets 11th graders help the freshman since they are new to the school, Robotics which also lets students attend in competition they build robots.', ""My favorite experience was meeting all the teachers and all my friends. What makes the school unique is many things the computer classes and what I like the most is internship senior year we get to work for credits and most students are able to get paid. Choosing to do this school year all over again is hard to decide because the projects we had to do for the computer classes weren't easy they were very challenging and senior year I am very happy I don't have to deal with all those projects anymore but going through all that again would be so bad it was a great expirience."", 'The teachers are great they make sure you understand the lesson if not they explain it differently to help you understand. Most teachers pull out students from class or wait till the end of the period to speak to them about their grades and how they need to improve or give extra credit work or let them hand in old class work that they have not done but half credit.', 'overall safety of the school is very high, it being such a big campus with different school in all honesty this is the best one out of the rest', ""the college advisory department it's not my favorite"", ""What makes this school the best is it's dedication to the students and to making sure we cross the finish line with the best education and life experiences possible behind our back""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['Quality of teachers is amazing, I think Mr. Abramowitz the principal really dedicates time to making sure the teachers are the best of his student.

Administration needs help, though, they definitely aren’t doing us any good. Most teachers are pretty nice and willing to work with you if you try but they need to get paid more. Students are big on popularity contests. Student government is a joke. Tbh this school is kinda a joke. I go through day to day personally almost robotically.

Truly sad.', 'Long Branch High School gives all students opportunities to achieve, get involved in leadership and take college prep classes.  In addition to the standard High School courses, Long Branch offers an Engineering and Health Science course of study.  There are even certain classes that offer college credit.  Students can choose to take honors classes and then have to succeed to remain in the program rather than test into them.

It is very easy school to get straight As in and doesn't require too much in order to just pass for the year."", 'My schooling experience was a good one, there were some hiccups where the other students caused issues but they were resolved fairly easily and quickly, and the education was well enough for a school that is not overly crazy. What I would like to see if a higher emphasis on the quality of education to have students strive for a better education.', 'Being a junior in high school, the classes taken that year are very important. There are many classes that the school offers for their students. Some teachers there care about the success of their students and would like to help their students gain confidence and pride in their work. There is a variety of clubs and sports that students can choose to join. If I were to change an aspect of the school, I would change the amount of tests given throughout the week.', 'Long Branch High School is truly what you make of it. The teachers really do want to see you succeed if you show them initiative.', 'It was a very interesting experience as I grew up grinding my way to my college days. Many sports/activities for student involvement and polite staff to aid them', 'They have good athletics and support every activity. there is a lot of diversity and you will make good friends.', 'I attended Long Branch High School for all four years of high school. I enjoyed my time there. All of my teachers were prepared and knowledgeable. They really cared about the students. One of the things I would change would be to include even more college prep classes and services.', 'I like the classes that are provided as well as the teachers. I would like to see a change in Jv teams in all sports as they are treated less fair.', ""Long Branch High School is a very diverse school which is a good thing because it gives you the opportunity to learn from other with different point of views. The 3 years a already spent in there have been such a good experience for me specially because of sports. I love playing sports and meeting new people. What i also like about it is the facility. A beautiful building and also a really beautiful football field. There is not much things i would want themto change but if i had to choose one it would be the food. Food isn't that great and its basically the same thing everyday. Teachers are very friendly and helpful.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","[""Most people are friendly.

Also, you will always find a friend here, whether it's one or 10."", 'Its a good school, you get offered many good opportunities although it would be better if there were more trips and fun things to do', ""I am proud to say that I graduated from MBA on June 2017. I am grateful for the dedication, guidance, and care that I received from all the staff in all four years that I was there. There was never a time where I felt alone, lost, or unsafe because there was always a teacher making sure that I was doing fine. We were all challenged by our teachers to work beyond our potential and that helped us improve drastically. Our college counselor was beyond amazing and helpful. In fact, he would stay extra hours after school to be by our side throughout the whole college process senior year. Thanks to MBA's efforts, I am now attending my dream college."", 'As a student who attended MBA I can say that the school can be better. There are a few good teachers here and there that  can be very helpful. Along the lines of college readiness i think that the school can improve in that area. There isnt much of a challege academic wise.', ""If I could do it all over again, I would definitely choose my school because the teachers and my peers have helped me grow into the young adult I am today.

Also, I've been exposed to outstanding business opportunities, which helped me decide what career I want to pursue in college."", ""The teachers in my school are extremely engaging and supportive of their students. We're lucky to have teachers we can rely on with academic and personal help."", ""In Manhattan Business Academy the health and safety of the students and staff is taken very serious. There is on duty staff every day and there are security camera's that lets the security officers know if there is anything alarming happening. Furthermore, if a student does not feel well he/she is sent to the nurses office or even sent to the hospital Mount Sinai."", ""Manhattan Business Academy offers many extracurricular activities such as Business Club, Wrestling, Sailing, Guitar Club, Anime Club, Art Club, etc. With all these extracurricular activities being offered in my school it honesty makes many students become very active and teaches them how to handle many things all at once. For instance, I am apart of the business Club and last year I had to create a business presentation for a Shark Tank presentation for the company Counsel Works. That is to say, I had to create the presentation and rehearse my presentation and also focus on studying for the U.S. History Regents in June and trying to pass all my classes with A's. At the end I was able to do the presentation, pass my U.S. History Regents with a 97, and pass my classes with A's. The Business Club helped me with time management and I learned how much pressure I could take as a teenager and what my breaking point was and is."", 'Overall, throughout the 4 years of my high school experience my school has changed my life. When I came into Manhattan Business Academy I was very irresponsible and immature. I would get into arguments with my peers and teachers because I felt that they were attacking me verbally. As the years went by I changed up my attitude with the help of my advisor that the school sets up for every student. I also began to care about my grades and improve them. I went from a C student in middle school to an A student in high school. My favorite experience was a Fun Day event that student government which I was apart of, set up. During the Fun Day my whole grade were split up into classrooms and we played movies and board games. It was a fun experience because everyone got together and set aside any differences they had and enjoyed themselves.', ""As a senior I've had my fair share of teachers that are great and not so great. However in my school I've noticed that teachers care of about students and want to see their students succeed in their life. Many teachers are tough on the students but its for our good.

There are no sports besides volleyball and basketball, and those sports don’t even have school games. The olympic sized swimming pool is amazing, but we can’t even use it.

If you focus, and study, you’ll get really high grades because of the curriculum. It’s easy to slip up sometimes, but most of the teachers are willing to give second chances. If you don’t have friends by junior year, then it’d be hard to make friends after. Most cliques get together freshman year, and people are usually very commited on sticking to one group. There are no sports besides volleyball and basketball, and those sports don’t even have school games. The olympic sized swimming pool is amazing, but we can’t even use it. Just stick to yourself and grades here and it’ll be fine. I do wish I had gone to a better high school. The phone policy is so annoying, along with the medal detectors. But yeah. Pretty low-average school.', 'To study here is the good thing, Staffs are very kind and friendly.

But on the first day of school, some of my classmates approached me and quickly became my friends (which to this day I still have). These weren't any ordinary classmates; these were the ones that were heavily involved in our classes, made friends with other teachers, students from other classes and grades. As I spent each day with them from freshman to senior year, I've definitely grown out of my fear and instead showed my inner self that was closed shut during freshman year. That inner self of mine was my weirdness. I've grown attached to this school because as I was losing my fear of acclimating to a new school, I was able to create some great memories in this school, made some new friends with students and teachers, experienced the rigor of school work and preparations for college. I'm glad I made the choice to go to this school."", 'I love the fact that the staff are so connected with the students and they all take time out of their days to help anyone and everyone.', ""Discovery High school brings a small yet compact high school experience. The small space of the high school allows for an easy navigation of the school and the large campus it's located on brings a lot of diversity in the people in the campus. The teachers are all fantastic with their own unique devotions to teaching and their own way of going about it, and no class feels quite like the next. The staff if friendly but stern on the rules and because of the school's close proximity to Lehman College the College Now program is easily accessible to all and very helpful in preparing for college. While at times the extra curricular actives may seem limited, Discovery does a good job at providing an interesting and impact experience on those who attend."", ""The first thing you notice when you walk up the steps of Discovery High School are three delicately painted portraits of our former President Barack Obama. I remember feeling encouraged and full of hope whenever I caught of glimpse of him. Being mostly an art school, the walls of Discovery were very animated with vivid colors and inspirational quotes on every corner. Though it was relatively small I felt that as a community we were closer than the other schools on campus. The teachers were very dedicated and enjoyed to teach. Discovery had a variety of subjects to offer as well as a diverse number of clubs to join.

In a nutshell NAHS is filled with a lot of kids, not all who don’t care about their education. In my perspective. They solely worry on the art of passing their classes so they can graduate. Beyond the topic of education, our pep rallies feel like one of a kind. Other schools might have mascots dressing up but there’s only two people who dress up as mascots and they know exactly how to rile up the crowd. There’s also a knockout game of basketball. Whats thrilling about this game is that the teachers are able to participate. It feels as if all your worries about exams and work thats due the next period just vanishes. All of the worry turns into the adrenaline you feel when they call your name when you do a sport that you are oh so proud of doing.

In a nutshell NAHS is filled with a lot of kids, not all who don’t care about their education. In my perspective. They solely worry on the art of passing their classes so they can graduate. Beyond the topic of education, our pep rallies feel like one of a kind. Other schools might have mascots dressing up but there’s only two people who dress up as mascots and they know exactly how to rile up the crowd. There’s also a knockout game of basketball. Whats thrilling about this game is that the teachers are able to participate. It feels as if all your worries about exams and work thats due the next period just vanishes. All of the worry turns into the adrenaline you feel when they call your name when you do a sport that you are oh so proud of doing. There are more things to this school that need improvement and things that don’t need changing, but these two reasons are why this school makes it a very interesting experience.', ""The school is great just that the school board does not have the children's best interest in mind. Funding is wasted on a new administration instead of education."", ""My experience in North Arlington High School has been great. The staff is amazing every teacher I've had I've loved and they make school feel like coming home."", ""It's a small school that doesn't allow kids to truly push themselves."", 'School does not have a lot to offer.  Town is very small.  Only one square mile.  I feel being so small we lose out on a lot of things.  It could definitely be better academically.  Does not offer a lot of different electives like other schools.  I feel like I am definitely at a disadvantage attending this school.  School is very old.  Needs to get with the times and update.  All the schools in the town are ancient.', 'The fact that it is a very small school made it more difficult for some students to enjoy and find an area where they fit in.', ""There aren't many courses offered outside of the required curriculum, but the classes that we have teach the students a lot. If a student feels that a specific class is not for them, they can change their schedule or even go into a virtual high school class, which is basically independent study. My favorite classes include accounting and sociology because I feel they have taught me the most while still being fun and interactive."", 'Though many students disagree with me, I like my school. It is a close knit community and bullying is not present. The teachers and staff are always there to help. My favorite thing about the school is the assemblies that are put together for students including anti-gang and suicide awareness presentations. If it were my choice, I would go to this school again because it feels like a second home.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['There are some extra curricular activities for the students.

Neptune High School,"['Neptune High School been on the news a few times... but honestly if i telling the truth the school is amazing, the kids are nice the teachers care a lot about the students. Everyday i wake up saying today is going to be such an amazing day. GO NEPTUNE!!!', 'I like Neptune’s sports and teachers. I also like the food as well and all of my classes as well. What I don’t like is the lack of safety in the school. Kids are bringing dangerous weapons here undetected and I don’t feel safe at all.', 'I came to NHS as a freshman. I meet new friends every year and look forward to my new classes. I wish the food and teachers were a bit better but I know every school isn’t perfect. Despite all the hate thrown at Neptune, we strive to do our best with helping any and everyone and I appreciate that.', 'I loved that Neptune High School is very diverse. However, I would like to see a change in the teacher involvement. I wish that teachers would really push students to go to college and help them with the application process.', 'There were bad moments were people fought and stuff but other than that the school is great. I had many great memories and I met amazing people there. The school also offers a lot of opportunities. It’s great.', ""It's a very diverse school and despite everything you hear in the media that makes it seem like a bad school, it's actually not. Everyone is friendly and it's easy to make friends."", ""This school has its perks. Being a student athlete at this school is a plus because you get to know many people and form bonds with your team. On the other side of the spectrum however, most teachers just teach to get paid and don't care to help students when they are in need of a boost. Administration is completely corrupt and they only do what seems right to them. They may not see the changes they have made, but the students do! Taking away sports and clubs and changing events that students have become accustomed to is just the start. While I do love my school and wouldn't want to go anywhere else, the bad outweighs the good in this case."", 'My experience at Neptune High school was pretty decent, and I breezed through all 3 and a half years of it so far. High school was either a make it or break it moment and it all depended on how you apply yourself in your classes and extra curricular activities. Now that my journey is coming to an end, I’m truly going to miss my high school years and ofcourse I have some regrets that I wish I could go back and change. For example, I’ve always wanted to get into doing a school sport but it took me two years into high school to actually build up the courage to do so, which is how I started my athletics in Track and Field, and met amazing new people. The only thing I would change about my high school experience would be the lunch, but who doesn’t want to change their lunch meals. I will cherish all the people that helped me throughout my journey and will miss them dearly as my senior year comes slowly to an end.', 'What i like about neptune high school is that we follow the rules, we keep the students safe, we help others, teachers are really nice and helpful. What i would like to see change about the high school would be the hours school start and the lunch.', 'Neptune High School is an all around average school. A lot of fights happen in this school which can be distracting to the class activities and everything going on around you. Some of the teachers are great and others have no idea what they are doing or just call out every other day without being disciplined.  A lot of people that go to this school do not really care for academics and are just there simply because they have to, not because they want to.  This leads people to consistently fail or barely pass classes and mess around in class, distracting others.  However, I got a good education at this school, so with all of that being said, Neptune High School is an average school.', 'Neptune High School was full of diverse people and the most helpful staff I could ever ask for. I would not change a thing about it.', 'I meet a lot of friends in that school i always had a good  time there everyday there was always something that was done that would make me laugh. I am still friends with those people to this day.', ""Neptune Highschool has multiple opportunities for students to get involved in, such as dozens of clubs and sports to participate in. The staff is dedicated to the success of the students, but the majority of students do believe that guidance could be better. Overall, my time here has been amazing and the good times and bad times I've had will always be memorable, especially the friends I've met on my highschool journey."", 'I loved everything about my high school always major activities, great clubs helping teachers. Always practiced great safety for us no child will ever be left behind', 'The staff is very friendly and always have the best in mind for the students. The school is very secure and it is very diverse.', 'Theres plenty of people from different background s to meet. The school dances are a lot of fun, too. There’s always a football or soccer or baseball game to watch, and so many clubs to join. One thing i would change are the school lunches.There not very tasty.', ""High school here was good, but like anything there's always room for improvement.  I feel like in some situations the teachers and administrators could be more relaxed, I remember how some students would get written up for petty things.  They shouldn't lock the bathrooms, instead they should just have security be posted at each bathroom just in case any trouble arises.

Altough the teachers are very kind they could push us more . I find the work very easy.One thing im very proud of is the school safety.Thesres not one moment that i feel sacard or unsafe .

The school is located on a huge beautiful campus, and administration was never a hassle to deal with. Overall  I recommend the school.', 'I liked the fact that the school was divided into three small learning communities. By doing this, it made the school feel smaller and created a bond between the student who were in the same learning community. The teachers were very good too and they actually care about you. It felt like a family.', 'As a Student at Queens High School of teaching, I learned all the necessary things I needed to graduate and move on to college prepared. All the main resources were available to me providing me the opportunity to work, stay on track for college attend college tours and take college courses, and lastly find volunteer opportunities. My only drawback is that the school no longer offered the extracurricular activities I was interested in other than the basic ones. But they gave you the resources to find what you needed outside of school. If you wanted a club to support whatever hobby you were interested in all you had to do was find a teacher to help and then make a list of students interested.

I remember the dreadful hours I had to stay in school from 9:30 to 4:30 but , it was so late in the morning to get to school so it shouldn't be a problem right? No, because their was a balance in time, the later you came the later you left and the earlier you came the earlier you left, like when I was in 10th grade.

In this school students are treated as middle schoolers  and we are not academically challenged.

In addition there is a lot of favoritism toward some students and teachers where at times students who work hard for a class get lower grades than those that have a good friendship bond with teachers. Clubs in the school are almost non existent and most facilities are almost never used. We just got a new soccer field but yet we don't get to use it at all the school next to the high school use it more the the students of the high school.

The small, close-knit classrooms allow students to feel welcome and give them the opportunity to create relationships with their teachers. Our schools needs to provide more clubs and the clubs need to be stressed just as much as the sports.

South Amboy Middle/High School,"['South Amboy High is not just a high school. The town middle school is also connected to it. What I liked about my school was how well the teachers were able to work with the circumstances given to them. They all adjusted to the new curriculum as it was given to them and they handled it better than most thought they would. The teachers were also very understanding and very respectful in noticing that not all students learn the same, they need different attention and learning techniques in order to obtain information. Something I wish would change is the administration. They care more about their image rather than the students.

Some of the teachers are very active and care a lot about the students while a few others should not be teaching altogether. When it comes to athletics, this school has no team of its own.

I\'ll admit, our school has its good days and bad but in the end it has lead me to amazing people. People that I am glad to call my friends, people who look out for me all the time and push me to be a better student/person. I\'m aware that you can find these kinds of people anywhere but it is specifically here, in this diverse school, that I can interact and connect with different people. We might not have the best sports or academic classes but I believe that once you truly get to know us, we have the best people and our hearts are full of canuck pride.', 'North Plainfield High School is about average. I’m disappointed with the academics though, I’ve had two teachers fired due to their inability to teach. This greatly affected me and my classmates, we didn’t have a teacher for almost six months and we did not learn anything in that time. Because of that I was placed in a CP class, it’s embarrassing that North Plainfield wasn’t on top of this right away.  Academics aren’t the best, the teachers don’t care very much and they can’t teach very well except if you’re in honors or AP classes. In addition North Plainfield High School offers a vocational program, full of half time, its a great opportunity. The music programs could be better as well if they didn’t fire band directors every two years and if we had a fund. There’s people of every ethnicity and the students are very friendly and welcoming. Overall, average school', 'Overall, I enjoyed my experience at North Plainfield High School. This is a diverse high school, bringing together different groups of people. It is a welcoming environment with lots of school spirit. Because of the contract situation, it impacted both the students and faculty because we could not fully have the ""high school experience."" The teachers are wonderful and do their job well. Although I wish they offered more classes in terms of AP courses, the workload was sufficient. However, I do not believe that they prepare students for college. It is an area that could use improvement.', ""North Plainfield is a very average school. There are some things the school does right and there are some things the school does wrong.  The regular classes at the school are not there to prepare you for college, however, if you get into an AP or honors class than those classes can help prepare you for college. The problem with this system is that starting from freshman year and even as early as 8th grade the student has to push hard to get into these advanced classes. If you're not on track by 9th grade then it becomes a lot harder to take AP and Honor courses. It also depends on the teacher you get. There several teachers at the school that not only enjoy their subject and teaching but also enjoy interacting with the students. Getting teachers like these, make learning more interesting and fun. I have had several teachers who actually want to have their students learn and push them to try harder."", 'There are bad schools and good schools.  This one is in the middle, thwy do the best they can despite the low budget. They have one of the best track and field programs in the area, however aside from that the sports could use some work.

The problem with this system is that starting from freshman year and even as early as 8th grade the student has to push hard to get into these advanced classes. If you're not on track by 9th grade then it becomes a lot harder to take AP and Honor courses. It also depends on the teacher you get.

There are many different programs offered to students that fall under their interest. Guaranteed there is something for everyone in this school.', 'Harry S. Truman High School is an excellent school providing that it is in the Bronx. The school is one of the only schools left that doesn’t have a thousand schools in one building.

For exmaple for gym; you can choose either fitness, swimming, basketball, volleyball, aerobics, dance, etc. It’s hard to get bored here at Truman.']","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']"

Manhattan Early College School for Advertising,"['I had an okay experience. however, I feel like there is a lot of things the school needs to work on to improve the school more.', ""My experience at Manhattan Early College School for Advertising has been a rocky one. One specific thing I personally love about the school is the college classes we are able to take at BMCC. While I was a Freshman and Sophomore, I learned everything in half a year, unlike any other school; they learn things in a years worth of time. Meca has motivated me to want more for my life and future. Now that I am a junior, they speak to me about college more often and try to prepare me for my future jobs. Meca has it's flaws but I feel like that is because it is a fairly new school. They are still adjusting and figuring everything out. The only problem I think takes place in that school is student involvement, which is a big problem. Students seem clueless in the school, Meca offers a lot of different opportunities but no one is aware of it because the school doesn't advertise it as much as they should."", 'This is a great school for people who want to get college experience by the end of their highschool years. You graduate with college credits that can be transferred and you can potentially be apart of internships that give you work experience. The teachers are great at supporting students in any way they can. There is academic support in all ways, tutoring, regents prep, and after school hours. Extra curricular activities can help you relax and have a fun highschool experience.', 'My experience at MECA has been a real rollercoaster. The school is getting better and improving each year and they came a long way!', 'I like how we got to experience college before we went to actual college because it prepared us in a way. Even though it cut out High school experience short because of the responsibilities we had to take on from being both high school and college students. It allowed us to see what college really is and to get ready.', 'I like that it provides an opportunities for both Junior and Senior classes to be able to take college courses earlier than the other schools. I would like to see change in the behavior in where teachers are not treating students as kids.', ""Honestly, this is a great school. The advancements and goals allowed me to be who I am today. Being a early college program, it gives students a better chance to reach their goals with the help the school provides. I personally was able to move forward and take on task I believe I wasn't ready for. Being able to take accelerated high school classes allowed me throughout my high school years to take college courses while earning college credits. This helps me save money financially and saves time since I grew up in a poor household."", 'MECA High School was a wonderful school where students were able to dual-enroll high school and college classes. Although the classes were taught at an accelerated pace, it gave students a head-start in their future careers, by easing the process when transitioning from high school to college.', ""My experience at Manhattan Early College was eventful and extremely well fitted for a student like me. I feel as though I was able to experience, not only, the high school life but also prepare myself for college life. I received college credits while taking regular high school classes in which I will be able to enter college, almost, a sophomore. I visited advertising agencies and was able to network among professionals I met. Overall, I feel well prepared for college and for adult-hood. However, I do feel as though my high school experience was a bit rushed as my school didn't provide many trips for students to bond nor were we allowed to relax much as we stressed over the year long classes that turned into only half a semester. There was no diversity among teachers and it was a bit overwhelming to see the lack of proper diversity in the people that I was to connect with."", 'Overall good academics, defiantly has some flaws to be worked on but it is a new school, I was from the first graduating class. A lot of diversity which is definitely good .', 'The school overall is pretty average. It is supported by BMCC so you get to take college classes there starting Junior year, which is really good. You also get a fully paid Associates degree from BMCC, if you choose to continue with them for 2 years. However, the administrators aren\'t the best, they don\'t really care too much about your feelings and issues that go on in the school, they are too ""busy"" to pay attention to you. The teachers are  very friendly but some don\'t teach very well so it can be frustrating at times, the sports are great they offer a good handful of sports since it is a PSAL school (they don\'t offer all sports on the PSAL sports list). Social wise the students are like any other school; they are intense but once you find the right group everything is okay. Because the school is right next to One Police Plaza there are security guards in the building at all times, it can get pretty hectic because there are 4 schools in one building.', ""MECA is an up and coming high school in the city that is changing what it means to be a 'high school.' MECA's 6-year model allows students to take the required coursework that allows them to graduate with 30 college credits if they choose to go on to a four year school or stay for two years more and receive their Advanced Regents diploma, an Associate Degree, and 2 years of paid work experience at one of the many industry partners affiliated with MECA. The school realizes that not all students will want to pursue a career in the Advertising industry, which is why resources are put into assuring students have the ability to explore all kinds of industries before they decide to stay for the two more years or go off to a 4 year school.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,,,

Start a friendship with some and they’ll end up helping you a lot while you do your time. There is outside lunch which is very nice since the cafeteria is small. Club activities are minimum but slowly growing as of 2019. If you are an athlete I do not recommend you this school. There aren’t many sports and gym has become ultimately boring but the teacher is very nice and means well. Overall I personally had a good experience but this school will not fully prepare you for college.

Majority of the teachers that attended the school were in my opinion of great quality, due to their high expectations.', 'Chelsea CTE High School has many different types of teachers and students, and ensures this diversity is expressed. There is minimal bullying because of the low tolerance for it. Any altercation is resolved with appropriate repercussions. The classroom spaces are large, but the amount of students in each is small, 20-25.

The stray kids are by far a minority and success in every aspect is always encouraged.', ""I attended Uniondale High School for two years. My two years at Uniondale High were actually not that bad I joined the track team and quickly I became very involved in school activities. Uniondale is a very great school in terms of resources, sports and academics. The only thing I would change is the food and maybe some of the faculty members. I feel as though some faculty memebers didn't really care about the students or their well being. I think that if the faculty members were fully engaged in the students the students will be fully engaged in school."", ""Went to school here 2011-2015. Some of the teachers and the school's general dedication to education were absolutely underrated, teachers and administrators who cared about their work were some of the best I've ever seen even compared to other local schools such as Kellenberg, which is notable for its better facilities, and were greatly respected by my peers. Much of the school's budget and efforts are placed on their varsity teams, while the arts departments were greatly lacking (orchestra and fine arts especially), show choir is an exception. College readiness is a HUGE thing at UHS and the school definitely takes pride for alum that make it to big name colleges. Took a while but I found myself among peers I got along with and respected, though if you aren't naturally social/are new, you'll definitely be seen by others as an outcast. If you are a local to Uniondale/Nassau then UHS should be a good school to go to.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--10', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I cannot wait to graduate out of this trash school.

Do not apply if you have a hard time trying to focus and multitask to the extreme."", ""Being a senior in the school of Fairchild Wheeler i have to say that I've seen a lot, happen in this high school. However my overall experience has been decent, i dont really have much bad things to say about this school. As much as i want to graduate already this school has educated me lots on colleges. Fairchild isn't like most schools, since it offers 3 different schools (Zoological/Biotech, Aerospace, and IT) most schools dont offer this. If you are interested in any of these 3 topics I suggest you attend this school. What i like about Fairchild is the campus itself, it makes me feel like im in some type of college. Being surrounded by nature is something i really enjoy, if you look out the window you see a beautiful scene, which at most time is relaxing. Something i would love to see change are some of the policies, some of them tend to be a little over the top but they exist in order for us to learn how a work place is once we are grown.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--50', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']","['I really like that the school is science based and therefore offers a variety of science classes to choose from in addition to other rigorous courses.

School of Science Technology Engineering & Mathematics,"['I enjoyed being at STEM and learned so much from my teachers and friends. When I was in 8th grade, I heard several rumors about STEM High school and the most common rumor was the students are not interested in school but more in goofing around and being childish. But when I went to the school, I realized there are several students who are smart, organized, and respectful. One thing I would change is the school food, because it looks disgusting and unhealthy.', 'My school is in an urban area and it is a very poor district. The safety is a very big issue, resources for SAT prep and any academic prep is very low, facilities are not focused by our administration and is hurting the image of the school. Within the school, there is disorganization in our grading system (Powerschool), as students are not allowed to check grades, and so if teachers make any errors; we are unable to see. The school overall is very poor and it makes it difficult for some of us college bound students to do anything with the limited resources that are given to us.', ""STEM is mediocre. The student and parental involvement is lacking where it shouldn't be. Students often coast by, while the administration tries it's best to assist them while not pushing them. Students, especially seniors, are coddled by teachers who don't want to face the ire of the parents and the district itself. STEM's downfalls are in the lack of rigorous courses and more opportunities for students who seek to get ahead to do so.  This to me is quite tragic: students are often pushed along because of the massive number of students in the school [John F. Kennedy Education Complex] as a whole. Consequently, some end up being mediocre students when they could have done much better if the staff had pushed them to realize their potential. STEM- despite it's  flaws- is a excellent school in comparison to the rest of the district. The teachers are great and the principals are supportive of students. STEM tries to nurture the best students.""]","['review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--40', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--20', 'review__stars__number__reviews', 'review__stars__icon', 'review__stars__icon--30', 'review__stars__number__reviews']",,,,,,

I would suggest a sports teacher who actually cares about the sport and is well educated in it to help the team improve.', ""I wouldn't want to be in any other high school. We're like a huge family.

The principal, Michael Barakat is very welcoming to all his students and strives for ways to ensure students pass. The school offers almost every club you can possibly think of: from mock trial to culinary club to student newspaper/press clubs In addition, Barakat has also implemented Quiet Time from the James Lynch foundation which teaches students how to meditate, I have to say VERY useful when combatting the stresses of student life. The school not only has clubs and meditation but they even offer a bunch of AP courses in courses such as World history, U.S history, Calculus, English, Literature, and Spanish. Lastly, the school also offers College Now courses in which also give you college credit like the AP courses. Overall, it is clear that the staff members care very much about the students here at Bronx High School for Law and Community Service.', ""I wish it was more academics offered but they are okay here.The work load sometimes is a lot but it's for the best depending on what class."", 'There is a good majority of different races and sexual orientation at my school.

First, never be afraid to choose your friends over your future because in the end, you only have yourself. Second, when you find a teacher that changes everything you thought you knew about a subject, a book or even life itself, keep in touch with them, they may always be able to provide valuable lessons and advice throughout your journey. The final and third lesson, is to keep fighting even when it seems like you may not survive any longer, because this is just the beginning. I am very grateful for my experiences in this school and for what they have taught me. It is and will always be a part of me.

I've been to this school and overall, the school experience is good if you are not LGBT and considered normal by society's gender roles.If your LGBT, I don't recommend you enrolling at this school. A lot of the students are not that friendly to the LGBT community and some teachers don't do much to stop the bullying. The school administration responds poorly to LGBT troubled students in this school. They often just tell them act normal and they have a very hard time coming out. This makes them feel worse which can lead to the school administration banning them access to school activities as a response instead of helping them feel better like mandatory parent meetings, safer school environment promotion and many other better methods. They separate almost anything by gender in this school like graduation ceremony line up. I repeat, DO NOT GO to this school if you are LGBT.
